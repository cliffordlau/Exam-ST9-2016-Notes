## Module Objective

Discuss the assessment of different types of market risks

***

All risk (credit, op, insurance, etc) should be analysed and model together and in a consistent fashion

* e.g. risk affecting both assets and liabilities should be analyse together

In addition to analysing risk at a particular time horizon, their evolution over time should also be examined (e.g. dynamic solvency testing)
