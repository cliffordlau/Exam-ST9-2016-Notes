## Module Objective

Understand the relevance of ERM to all stakeholders

* Discuss the relevance of risk measurement and management to all stakeholders
* Discuss the risk arising from any misalignment of interests between different groups of stakeholders

***

Consider the **objectives** of various `stakeholders` and their **interest in ERM**

* Also consider how these **interest may conflict**

This module covers different areas relating to the implementation of the ERM process within an org., including an understanding of the wide range of stakeholders to whom ERM is relevant and issues arising from this

***Exam note:***

* For any given scenario, needs to be able to **identify** the **main stakeholders** and discuss their **roles**

* Need to be able to analyze a scenario from the **RM perspective of a specified stakeholder**

* **Compare** and **contrast** this with the RM perspective of another class of stakeholder

## Stakeholders

There is typically a wide range of stakeholders for whom risk measurement and management is highly relevant

***Stakeholder***:  
Someone who **supports** and **participates** in the **survival** and **success** of a company

* Stakeholders nowadayws requires more risk transparency

* Stakeholders can be *categorized* based on their **relationship to the company**

| Category  | Relationship                               | Example |
| --------- | ----------------------| ---------------------|
| **Principal** | Contribute capital and/or expect a return  | `Shareholders`; `debt-holders`; `customers`; `government`; `insurance market`; `financial market` |
| **Agency**    | Paid by principals to perform a specific role on their behalf | `Company directors`; `pension scheme` trustees and administrators; `company managers`; `employees`; `auditors`; `investment managers` | 
| **Controlling** | Supervise the principals or their agents | `Professional bodies`, `regulators`, `industry bodies`, `government` |
| **Advisory** | Advise the principal or their agents | `Actuaries`; `lawyers`; `credit rating agencies`; `investment advisers`; `shareholder service providers` |
| **Incidental** | Affected by the behavior and actions of the principal or their agents | `Creditors`; `suppliers`; `other business partners`; `general public`; `media` |

### Shareholders

***Characteristics and Roles***:

* **Seek a good return** on their investment (dividends and share value) taking into account the inherent degree of risk
  
    * Strong interest in protecting against serious downside  
    (e.g. any events that could cause a collapse in the share price)
  
    * Equally may seek value creation through risk-taking
  
    * May prefer `short term` gain (public s/h) or `long term` investment (private s/h)

* **Relies** on `directors` and `auditors` to safeguard their investment (except)

* Have **limited power** (unless majority holding) until problems become significant

***Shareholder service providers / proxy advisors***

* Act on behalf of shareholders

* Express considered views on the company  
(e.g. `corporate governance`, `Board composition`, `remuneration`)

* (8optionally*) manage their **proxy voting**

Shareholder becomes more influential and vocal on controversial issues when they subcontract their responsibilities to such organization

Concerns on the role of proxy advisers:

* Power but **no responsibility**: they can influence a high proportion of voting rights but have no interest in the outcome of the vote
* Potential for **conflict of interest**: some firms provide consulting and other services to the companies on which they are making voting recommendations
* **"Tick-box" (quantitative) methodology**: common template is applied to all firms with little considerations being given to qualitative aspects of the individual circumstances of each company being assessed

### Customers and Policyholders

Characteristics and Roles:

* Seek both good value for money and security of the company
*  Very weak individually but collectively can have greater power
    * Especially when supported by consumer advocacy groups
* Have different perspectives depending on the type of org.
    * Bank customers: similar risk appetite as debtholders
    * Building society account holders: similar risk appetite as shareholders
    * Insurance company p/h: can be either pure customers or shareholders (mutual company)
    
#### Aspects of Customer Management

***Acquiring*** new customers (and retaining)

* Can increase value by improvements in attracting and retaining the right customers
* Company in practice have high customer turnover
* Retention is particularly important as it is cheaper to retain
* Long term customers are particularly valuable as they tend to purchase larger quantities, less price sensitive and more likely to recommend the company

***Retaining*** customer **loyalty**

* Dissatisfied customers will leave and might dissuade potential customers from purchasing
* Not sufficient to merely satisfy a customer, need to perform sufficiently well to retain the customer's loyalty (i.e. continues to purchase from the company)

***Knowing*** your customer

Customer surveys, feedback and data mining

Keep in mind of customer privacy

Effective ***crisis management***

Crisis generally damages reputation unless handled well (with might actually enhance it)

Company should have contingency plans in place before a crisis occurs

* Should not try to cover it up, should be honest
* Act swiftly and resolve it
* Keep stakeholders informed
* Focus on the long-term future of the business rather than minimizing short term cost

### Directors

Characteristics and Roles:

* Need to balance the needs of other stakeholders w/ their own personal goals (which may be influenced by the form of remuneration)
    * NED can conflict with shareholders with things such as need to maintain their directorship and remuneration
* Have significant duty of care in terms of risk management
* Need to fully understand the business and are able and willing to challenge management decisions
* Need to ensure that the company remains compliant with all relevant regulation
* NED: responsible purely for safeguarding the interests of shareholders
* ED: hold roles within the firm and can be considered to an extend as employees
* Share similar risk perspectives as shareholders (they are shareholder's agents)
    * Additional responsibility of determining the value of the assets and liabilities of the company
* ED being employees will share the same risk perspectives as employees

### Employees

Characteristics and Roles:

* Should be part of the day-to-day ERM process (not just ERM and IA)
* Job security and benefits is directly related to the profitability and security of the company
* Part of the company's op-risk (management and retention of staff and their inherent expertise)

Employees that may present higher levels of agency risk

* Employees further down the organization org. chart
* Members of unions (may organize strikes, demand standardized wage arrangements and can influence employee's morale)
* Free agents

#### Aspects of Employee Management

3 key aspects of employee management and the potential effects of each

***Recruitment***

Companies need to identify and recruit the right individuals

Cash compensation, incentives and benefits are important

***Retnetion, promotion and training***

Turnover can be costly as skills and knowledge are lost (or strengthen a competitor)

Employee morale, retention and productivity can be improved by career development programmes and continual training

Important that employees feel valued and that their achievements are recognized

***Dismissal and resignations***

Large scale redundancies adversely affect morale and can lead to voluntary resignations by other (perhaps highly value employees)

Managed programme of dismissals (up or out) can increase employee motivation

Exit interviews are good ways to find out why employees are leaving and can address these issues for the future

***

Key groups of employees to align their interest with shareholders

* Central risk function and CRO (assess the level of risk across the org. and enforce risk management policies)
* Pricing teams (instrumental in ensuring the profitability of the company)

Important to align their interests with those of the shareholders through proportionate rewards for taking appropriate risk

### Regulators

Characteristics and Roles:

* Ensure companies comply with the relevant regulatory standards
* Protect the stability of markets
* Balance is key, needs to be sufficient controls to protect other stakeholders (customers and p/h) but can not be so restrictive that the market is constrained and can not operate freely and efficiently
* Need appropriate intervention process that ensures that issues are dealt with in good time but also allows opportunity for correction and improvement (avoid closing down operations unnecessarily)
* More details in Mod 5

**Post 2008 Regulatory/Superivsory Change**

Regulators haven taken a much greater interest in companies' RM practices and capital requirements and stress tests have become more stringent since 2008

Companies are subjected to more regulation from multiple sources (e.g. gov and stock exchange) $\therefore$ Boards are more actively involved in the oversight of risk (esp. strategic risk)

* Updated SEC disclosure requirements
* Temporary bans on short-selling
* Dodd Frank
    * New regulators: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in US
    * Requirements for banks to have an orderly liquidation plan
* Replacement of the FSA with PRA and FCA in UK (mod 5)
* Greater likelihood that a company's regulatory capital requirement will exceed those determined by their own internal model

### Government

Characteristics and Roles:

* Set regulations and legislation
* Intervene when companies get into trouble
    * Lender of last resort
    * Nationalization of a company that would otherwise fail

4 key risks faced by governments

* Insufficient tax revenues
* Inappropriate insolvencies (failure of strategically important org. lead to contagion risk)
* Regulatory arbitrage
* Electoral losses

### Professional Advisors

Characteristics and Roles:

External auditors

* Perform annual reviews of accounts
* Assessments of the inherent risks and the ways in which those risks are being managed
    * Effectiveness depend on the degree of disclosures and the extent to which issues are hidden by the management of a company
* Duty to report openly and honestly on the state of the company on behalf of shareholders and regulators

Other professional advisers

* Request from management to investigate and report on specific matters (e.g. provide assurance or otherwise to the various stakeholders)
* Bring independent technical expertise and industry bench-marking information
    * Management doesn't have to act on their findings

3 risk faced by professional advisers:

* Reputational risk
* Risk of litigation
* Conflict of interest (e.g. same accounting firm providing both audit services and consulting services to the same client)

### Credit Rating Agencies

Characteristics and Roles:

* Act as gatekeepers to companies wishing to raise capital
* Strong influence on share price and can influence the view of external observers
* Nowadays place much greater emphasis on risk management
* Conflict of interest from needing to protect reputation and the way their income is generated

2 risk faced by credit rating agencies

* Reputational risk
* Conflict of interest

### Creditors

Characteristics and Roles:

* Require repayment of the monies own to them
* Mostly interest in the security of the company over the repayment term
* Not concern about specific risks as long as debt are paid
* In difficulty, might waive interest payments in order to secure repayment of part of the capital

Key risk for bondholders

* Depends on debt seniority, presence of security or covenants
* Private debt (e.g. bank facility) is less liquid and more risky
* Debt finance considerations
    * Taxation (interest being tax deductible)
    * Risk of insolvency
    * Agency cost
    
Trade creditors risk

* Lack of power to have their debt repaid

### Subcontractors and Suppliers

Characteristics and Roles:

* Affect directly by the failure of a company or its processes
    * Both in respect of future income and being potential creditors
* Companies themselves are exposed to the risk of failure of subcontractors and suppliers (esp. when cost of replacement is high)

### Trustees and Beneficiaries of the Pension Scheme

Characteristics and Roles:

* Demand security of the pension scheme (dependent on the overall financial security of the sponsoring company)
* Need to balance scheme security with the cost of benefit provision
    * Can choose to close a weak scheme rather than increase contributions (might not be in the best interest of active members)

Risk perspectives of **DC scheme members**

* That of a p/h of investor
* Share similarities with creditors (e.g. if employer's contribution are unpaid)

Risk perspectives of **DB scheme members**

* More similar to that of debtholders or customers
* Scheme sponsor's perspective is that of an equity provider in that they benefit from any surplus but may need to provide additional funds

Risk perspectives of **scheme trustees**

* Same perspective as members (as they are member agents)
* May have conflict of interest depending on their other relationships to the scheme

### General Public

Characteristics and Roles:

* Interest through being most of the above (s/h, bond/h, employees, pension scheme members, existing/future customers, taxpayers or the dependents of any of these stakeholders)
* Can be heavily influenced in their assessment of org. and of risk events by the way in which they are reported

Speed and geographical spread of the distribution of information has increased from internet and related technologies

In can be debate that media have a duty to ensure that reporting is responsible and in the public interest

* Irresponsible reporting can exacerbate the reaction of those with limited access to other information or with limited expertise and can escalate the problems

### Business Partnerships

**Benfits** of a strategic alliance:

* Faster product development
* Access to new markets
* Sharing of financial risks
* Benefit from economies of scale

**Potential pitfall** of a strategic alliance:

* Conflicts of interest
* Waste of resources
* Damage to reputation
* Loss of intellectual capital and disputes over intellectual property

Many business partnerships fail to achieve their objectives

Ways to maximize chance of success

* Only form an alliance if it really is the best options
    * Only to meet a specific goal that can best be met through an alliance
    * Best if significant control is required but a full merger is unnecessary
* Find the right alliance partner
    * Need a decision making team and should reach agreement on the goals of the alliance
    * Should develop a set of criteria against which potential partners can be evaluated and a ranked list of potential partners
    * Whole team should meet and grade each potential partner
* Monitoring the progress of the alliance carefully
    * Standard financial measure may not be appropriate initially
        * Focus on quality of work etc
    * Alliance should not be starved of resources and staff turnover needs to be low
    * Work of the alliance may need to be reviewed and refocused regularly

## Conflicts between Stakeholders

Conflict between stakeholders will arise due to different objectives

* Companies should develop a clear understanding of each stakeholder's interest
* Interests should be aligned where possible, with this information recorded and disseminated amongst the stakeholders
* Stakeholder interest and requirements should be reflected in the corporate business plan

### Agency Risk

Board runs the business for the benefit of the owners (e.g. s/h)

Separation of management and ownership an be **beneficial**

* Have those with expertise in running a business to have decision making responsibilities without investing capital
* Investors can invest without getting involved with day-to-day running of the company
* Continuity of management despite frequent change in owners

***

**Agency risk**:  
When interest of the owner and agent are not fully aligned, the agent may not always act in the interest of owners

* Similar concept: problem of agency, principal-agent problem, agency dilemma
* Difficulties that arise under conditions of incomplete and asymmetric information when a principal hires an agent

Manager may have different interest to shareholders

* Can arise due to the way in which management team is compensated
* Reward short term profits rather than long term investment

Executive comp. is an important consideration and an end objective of an ERM framework should be ensuring that compensation schemes take into account risk in an appropriate manner

* e.g. Ibanker who are rewarded for good results yet the downside for poor performance is limited

**Agency Cost**:  
Cost arising from agency risk

* Can include costs associated with mitigating agency risk
* e.g. developing astute and robust rmuneration and reward schemes, monitoring the actions of others and seeking to influence their actions
* Include actual losses from these actions

Conflicts or agency risks arise in many situations

* Remuneration of key employees
* Financing decisions
* Situations involving a dominant CEO
* Management decisions

### Remuneration of Key Employees

Agency risk played a role in 2008 crisis

* Underlying misalignment of the interest of employees, management and shareholder in banking due to the short term and asymmetric nature of employee and management reward structure
* e.g. Employees were given bonuses based on the growth in the total amount loaned $\therefore$ curtailing lending can put loan officer's career at risk
* Shareholder's interest for the bank was to only lend to fundamentally sound borrowers
* Competitive forces (such as one bank offering 100% mortgages) exacerbating the lending spiral and drove expansion into higher risk (sub prime) lending
* e.g. US NINJA loan and UK 120% mortgages

### Financing

Potential conflict between providers of finance

* Lenders (banks, bondholders) and the providers of equity capital (s/h)
* Difference between the lender's short-term desire for security and the s/h's long term interest in the sound development of the company

### Dominant CEO Risk

Risk that the CEO surrounds themselves with "yes" people

* Who try to win favor with the CEO irrespective of the risks that their decisions generate for shareholders and other stakeholders

Can exist further down the hierarchy in the form of a very dominant manager or team leader

Example:

* Equitable Life and the Mirror Group (Mod 32) and Confederation Life
* The latter collapsed in 1994 with losses estimated $1.3 bn after a high risk investment strategy set by its domineering Chairman

### Low-risk Management Decisions

Mangers try to ensure their personal job security by making low risk investment decisions

* Similarly penalize the company's long term profitability and the s/h return
* Manager may resist M&A that might threaten their own prospects
    * e.g. Yahoo's resist of takeover by MS in 2008

### Regulators and Government

Remuneration and career prospects of regulator and politicians may be misaligned with the interest of the general public

Example:

* Financial crisis typically lead to greater regulation and higher remuneration of regulators
* Absence of direct penalties to regulators from failure to regulate the market and market participants properly can result in dysfunction
* Can further misalign their interest with those of the market and the general public

Debate is on-going on the role of (lack of) regulation as a contributor to the global crisis

* Can be argues that some UK regulators have been "punished" as the regulatory system is subsequently restructured

Politician's inherent interest to get re-elected, they can aim to support policies that upset the least number of people in the short term rather than those that are the best long term solutions

* Pursuing the "line of lease resistance" rather than the "line of greatest advantage"
