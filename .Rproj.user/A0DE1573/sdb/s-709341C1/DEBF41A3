RM can benefit society**\n\n* Modern Society relies on the banking and financial systems to operate smoothly\n* Contagion risk\n\n**2. RM is part of the job of management**\n\n* The Board is supposed to optimise risk/return decisions for shareholders\n* Investors/fund managers is several degrees away for effective risk management as it requires:\n    * Historical data on risk/return results, volatilities and correlations\n    * Risk exposure and concentration in the business\n    * Future business and investment plan that may alter the firm's risk profile\n\n**3. Reduce earnings volatility**\n\nPredictable earnings:\n\n* $\\uparrow$ MV of firm\n* $\\uparrow$ Company's credit rating\n* $\\downarrow$ Variability in employee costs\n* $\\downarrow$ Capital requirements\n\n**4. Maximize shareholder value**\n\nManagement can make better decisions given a better understandig of the risks the company faces $\\Rightarrow$ $\\downarrow$ cost of capital, $\\uparrow$ risk/return trade off\n\n* Better target investment returns and product pricing that reflects the underlying risks\n* Appropriate capital allocation to achieve optimal risk-adjusted return\n* Company has the appropriate skills to manage all of its risks to protect against large financial losses or damage to its reputation\n* Perfromance metrics and incentives are aligned with the enterprise's business and risk objectives\n* Key management decisions explicitly incorporate the element of risk\n\n**5. Enhance job security and rewards**\n\n* RM is a required competence for senior management\n* Benefits employee with stock options\n\n***\n\nRisk appetite and risk profile\n\n* Need a clear statement of risk appetite and profile to make decisions on which risk to accept or avoid\n* Risk appetite = risk a company is willing to accept on an ongoing basis\n* Risk profile = types of risks that a company faces and its current exposure to those risks\n\n## Benefits of ERM\n\n**1. $\\uparrow$ risk transparency $\\Rightarrow$ management more informed $\\Rightarrow$ improve business performance**\n\nERM takes responsibility for risk reporting across the whole organization to ensure that *all risks* are reported in a *consistent* and appropriate format to stakeholders thereby $\\uparrow$ *risk transparency*\n\n$\\Downarrow$\n\nERM allows senior management to be more informed when making decisions due to:\n\n* Better understanding of risk exposure\n* Better comprehension of the links between growth, corporate risk and return\n* Better understanding of the impact of $\\Delta$-ing external factors (e.g. interest rate)\n* More accureate accessment of a decisions's risk/return trade-offs\n* Align strategy more closely with risk appetite\n\n$\\Downarrow$\n\nImprove business performance\n\n**2. Improve operational effectiveness**\n\n* *Co-ordinating* risk management activities across all parts of the organization\n* Encourage and facilitating the *sharing of risk information*\n* Identifying and assessing *links* between risks managed by various teams\n* Improving efficiency (w/ management time and business resources)\n\n**3. Enhance business performance**\n\n* More efficient use and allocation of capital\n* Minimize losses\n* Improve pricing, managing, transferring risks better\n* Optimizing risk mitigation strategies (e.g. natural hedges between BUs)\n* Reacting more quickly to opportunities (or risks)\n* Gain value from RM\n\n**4. Integration Adds Value**\n\nRisks faced by companies are highly interdependent $\\Rightarrow$ Silo based RM is not efficient or effective\n\n* Missing the interdependencies, associated risks maybe not be captured and the big picture maybe be overlooked\n* Challenge of aggregating risk exposures across the organization\n\nERM has integrated analyses, strategies, and reporting $\\Rightarrow$ Addresses interdependencies and aggregate expsoures\n\nERM supports the alignment of oversight functions (risk, audit, compliance) and rationalize risk assessment, risk mitigation, and reporting activities\n\nERM consider how macro factors impact the organization's risk/return profile\n\n**System integration** allows for enterprise level data management, robust business and data analytics, straight through transaction processing, and more effective reporting and information sharing\n\nIntegration of **strategy** and risk allows a company's managment to better understand and challenge the underlying assumptions and risks associated with the business strategy\n\n* Driver of market value declines are driven by strategic risks 60% of the time, op risk 30% of the time and then financial risks\n\n\n\n## Reasons to Initiate ERM\n\nStakeholder's expectation of effective risk management practice due to increased in available tools to assess and manage risk\n\nCompany usually pressured to implement ERM due to:\n\n* Previous management failures\n* Near miss\n* High profile disaster in another organization\n* Regulator/auditor criticism or demands\n* Other stakeholders concerns\n\n## How ERM Addes Value\n\nBased on Lam Ch.21 case study\n\n* Investors will pay a premium for well governed companies\n    * On the flip side, they would avoid companies with poor governance standards\n\nCompanies with strong governance structures:\n\n* Sought after by investors\n* Purchased at a premium (12-30%)\n* Tend to outperform companies with weaker governance\n* Lower volatility of returns, improved s/h value, financial stability, 16% equity premium (For insurance companies)\n* Perform better during stock market crashes (e.g. 2008, companies with excellent S&P EMR rating did better)\n\nEffect is amplified for larger companies",
