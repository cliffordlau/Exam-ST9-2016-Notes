If so the risk needs to be monitored\n    * Remove, reduce or transfer the risk\n    \nKey objective: Maximize risk adjusted return\n\n## ERM\n\n**Definitions**\n\n*Risk is a variable that can cause deviation from an expected outcome. ERM is a comprehensive and integrated framework for managing key risks in order to achieve business objectives, minimize unexpected earnings volatility, and maximize firm value* - Lam 2014\n\n*ERM is a process, effected by an entity's board of directors, managment and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and across the enterprise, desinged to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be within its appetite, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of entity objectives* - COSO 2004\n\n*Risk is the \"effect of uncertainty on objectives\" and risk management refers to \"coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk\"* - ISO 31000\n\n*ERM is the discipline by which an organisation in any industry assesses, controls, exploits, finances, and monitors risks from all sources for the purpose of increasing the organisation’s short- and long-term value to its stakeholders* - CAS ERM Research Committee: Overview of Enterprise Risk Management 2002\n\n***\n\n**ERM framework** is a formalized process of details on how to accomplish the following:\n\n* Recognize the context\n* Identify the risks\n* Assess and comparing the risks with risk appetite\n* Deciding on the extent to which risks are managed\n* Taking the appropriate action\n* Reporting on and reviewing the action taken\n\n### History of ERM\n\n![](figures/figure-01.01.png)\n\n### ERM Implementation\n\nCompanies need to take a strategic view about how ERM aligns with the insurer’s values, culture and approach\n\nRisk management frameworks developed in a piecemeal or ad hoc manner is unlikely to garner broad-based support across the organisation and will more likely reinforce a view that ERM is something more akin to a compliance exercise\n\n**Enabling environment for implementing ERM**  \n\n* Demonstrable executive management support is critical\n\n* Strong and direct linkages must be made between ERM and the company’s\nbusiness strategy and its day-to-day operations\n\n* The company must establish clear account abilities for the various aspects of risk management, distinguishing between those in line management roles and those in risk management roles\n\n**Board's Role in ERM Implementation**\n\nKey to implementation is buy in and support from the Board  \n$\\therefore$ Needs to inform the board about issues they want and need to know about\n\n* ERM is one of the few truly enterprise wide business capabilities that both provides an opportunity to change the way an organisation does business, but also can be ‘used’ to drive certain agendas that may not be aligned to the business imperatives, and stakeholder needs\n\n* The output of ERM may not suit all stakeholders, so Board buy-in with\nmanagement is critical to ensure needs and expectations are met and the ERM investment delivers maximum return and minimizes any agency/stakeholder bias\n\n* The Board is well placed to take a strategic and holistic perspective to ensure long term sustainability of the ERM investment\n\n**Key learnings for ERM Implementation**\n\n* Setting clear objectives for the delivery of expected outcomes associated with the ERM project\n* Assigning experienced and suitably skilled resources using a rigorous selection process\n    * Particular with respect to project leadership and change management roles\n* Sufficient detailed planning upfront to reflect realistic effort / time frames\n* Implementing rigorous processes to tightly manage scope, gated criteria for milestones and cost / benefits\n* Clear executive-level ownership and accountability for delivery of all project aspects (appropriate project governance)\n* Realism about the expected “pain” through early stages of implementation and support required\n* Realism around complexity, cost and time frames\n* Thorough risk management / mitigation strategies and support processes\n* An organisational culture that demands objective and transparent project reporting and rapid escalation (and welcoming) of “bad news” so that problems get addressed earlier and at less cost\n\n### Key Concepts of ERM\n\nNo universal definition of ERM, just various central themes and general agreement on the overall concept\n\n* From IAA: holistic, integrated, top-down, strategic approach and value-driven, aligning strategy\n\n**1. Holistic Approach**\n\nERM involves holistic consideration of risk information relating to past events (e.g. losses), current performance (e.g. risk indicators) and future outcomes (e.g. the risk profile or risk assessment)\n\nConsidering the risks of the enterprise as a whole; concern with all risk faced by the enterprise\n\n* Can appreciate the *concentration* of risk that arise from variety of sources within the enterprise\n* Account for *diversification* across the enterprise\n\nRM techniques are applied consistently across the whole enterprise   (e.g. Common definitions, classifications and recording of risk)\n\n* This is necessary for RM to operate effectively\n* From top down (lead by the board) $\\Rightarrow$ Coordinate through risk management function (e.g. IRM) that is lead by a CRO $\\Rightarrow$ Incorporate into the day to day operations of all personnel\n\nEnsures that all risks faced by an enterprise are considered\n\n* Taken into account links between risks from different parts of the business\n\nAlso ensure the same risk appetite for the whole enterprise\n\nThis is one of the main additional elements of ERM to traditional RM\n\n**2. Upside and downside Risk**\n\nUpside risk = Better than expected outcome\n\nImportant to consider both upside and downside risk when outcomes is not symmetrical\n\n* Risk = uncertainty and volatility\n\nERM should allow company to exploit upside risks (opportunities)\n\n* Need to thoroughly understand the risks the company faces to determine if there's capacity to take on more risk\n\nERM can create value by seizing suitable opportunities to optimize risk-adjusted return\n\n* In addition to minimizing effect of downside risk\n\nIntegrate RM and measurement into the business processes and strategic decision making\n\n* Value creation is one of the additional elements of ERM to traditional RM\n    \n**3. Quantifiable Risks**: Risk that can be measured in some way\n\nMeasurement of risk (after the risk is identified)\n\n* E.g. ranking, assessment of the absolute levels of risk\n* To determine whether the level of risk is acceptable\n\nGood risk measurement practices are essential to ERM\n\n* Financial impact of a risk\n    * e.g. risk of counter-party default, risk of interest rate $\\Delta$\n* Likelihood of its occurrence over a given time horizon\n\n**4. Unquantifiable Risks**: Risk that cannot be measured\n\n* E.g. due to unidentifiable loss distribution; difficult to assess nature of the risk\n* Often these are operational risks, e.g. terrorist attack on firm HQ\n\nImportant to consider these risks and assess them in a qualitative way\n\n* E.g. consider the likelihood and severity into low, mid, high\n\nERM is concerned with both behaviors (the risk management \"culture\") and\nrisk control processes\n\n**5. Risk Responses**\n\n* Need to consider responses after identification (and quantified)\n* Doing nothing can be a response as well as mitigating the risk\n\nRetain:  \nCompany is happy to live with the risk\n\n* E.g. small risk; type of risk the company is well place to deal with\n* Or just the other options are unfeasible\n\nRemove:\n\n* e.g. Cease production of a risk LoB\n\nReduce:\n\n* Either reduce in potential severity or frequency\n\nTransfer:\n\n* e.g. Purchase insurance or outsourcing (like IT or security)\n* Need to compensate the party assuming the risk",
