For return on **individual equities**:\n\n    * Returns are **rarely** *iid*\n    \n    * **Volatility vary** over timer\n    \n    * Extreme returns appear in clusters (**volatility clustering**)\n    \n    * Return series are **leptokurtic** (heavy tail, non symmetric)\n\n2. For return on **protfolios of equities**:\n\n    * **Correlations** exist between returns of different series (e.g. different equities) at the same point in time (true for other asset classes as well)\n\n    * **Correlations** between different series **vary over time**\n\n    * `Multivariate` **returns** data show **little evidence of cross-correlation**\n    \n        (i.e. between time periods $t$ and $t+1$)\n\n    * `Multivariate series` of **absolute or squared returns** do show **strong evidence of cross-correlation**\n\n    * Extreme returns in one series often coincide with extreme returns in several other series\n    \n        (i.e. level of **dependence are higher during periods of high volatility**)\n\n***Model assumptions vs key characteristics***\n\n* Models we typically do use (*incorrectly*) **assume that log-returns are *iid***\n\n    * e.g. Random walk for the development of log-prices in discrete time\n\n    * e.g. Geometric Brownian motion model for the development of prices in continuous time\n\n***Trends and correlation***\n\n* There are **little serial correlation**\n\n* Returns **do follow trends** over **short periods**\n\n* **Correction do happen** over the longer terms but any such correlation is **insufficient to support significant profit taking**\n\n* Overall it is **very difficult to predict** the return in the next period given only the history of the process\n\n    $\\therefore$ best estimate of tomorrow's return given the daily return up to today is 0\n\n***Time horizon***\n\n* As the time period over which we calculate the return increases, the features noted [above](#ts-char) tend to **become less pronounced**\n\n* Volatility clustering is less marked and returns appear to be more *iid* and less heavy tailed (as expected from CLT)\n\n***Volatility***\n\n* **Volatility**:\n\n    **Conditional standard deviation** of returns given historical data\n\n* **Volatility clustering**:\n\n    When **extreme** values tend to be **followed by** other **extreme** values (not necessarily of the same sign)\n\n* `Serial correlation` between absolute or squared returns is *consistent with* the phenomenon of volatility clustering\n\n* Volatility clustering supports the idea that `conditional s.d.` are changing in a way that is **to some extent predictable**\n\n    This is the justification for the $ARCH$ and $GARCH$ previously\n\n***XS kurtosis***\n\n* **Kurtosis**: \"Peakedness\" of a distribution\n\n* Kurtosis for `daily financial return` is *higher* than that of a `normal distribution`\n\n    $\\therefore$ has XS kurtosis\n\n* Higher kurtosis $\\Rightarrow$ more of the variance is due to **infrequent extreme deviations** (vs frequent modestly-sized deviations)\n\n* Distribution of daily financial returns data is **leptokurtic**\n\n    i.e. more **acute peak** around the `mean` (higher probability than a normally distributed variable of value near the mean) and **fatter tails** (higher probability than a normally distributed variable of extreme values)\n\n* Observed data suggest that the distribution of `daily financial return` has **tails that decay more slowly** than those of a `normal distribution`\n\n    $\\hookrightarrow$ We tend to get more extreme values from returns data than we would for normally distributed data\n\n* The **kurtosis** $\\downarrow$ as the **period** over which we are measuring returns $\\uparrow$ (e.g. to monthly)\n\n    Which is consistent with volatility clustering\n\n### Modeling Market Risks\n\nCan be modeled with the full range techniques from Module 15\n\n* e.g. `historical simulation`, `forward looking factor` (or data) based approach\n\n***Example***:\n\n* **Forward looking factor based** approach to modeling `corporate bond yields` might describe the complex links between variables such as:\n\n1. Risk-free yield\n\n2. Coupon rates\n\n3. Credit spread\n\n***Caveat***:\n\n* Be aware not to project history blindly into the future by recognizing an **unsustainable trend**\n\n* Should also use the past to **model the uncertainty** of yields (rather than their absolute level)\n\n#### Data-based modeling\n\n...Using the multivariate normal distribution\n\n**Forward looking data based** approaches may *assume* that **changes in the log returns** are *linked* by **multivariate normal distribution**\n\n***Steps for modeling***:\n\n1. Pick the **frequency** of calculation (e.g. daily, weekly, etc)\n\n2. Pick the **time-frame** of `historical data` to be used\n\n    (Trade off between `volume` and `relevance`)\n\n3. For each asset class, *choose* the **total return index** $S_t$ to use\n\n4. For each asset class, *calculate* the **log-return**:\n\n    $X_t = \\ln \\left(\\dfrac{S_t}{S_{t-1}}\\right)$\n\n5. *Calculate* the **average returns** and **variance** of each asset class and the **co-variance** between each class (and sub-set of classes)\n\n6. **Simulate a series of returns** with the same characteristics based on a multivariate normal distribution\n\n* The last 2 requires some matrix math (Cholesky decomposition of an unbiased estimator of $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})$, based on the historical data)\n\n***Limitations***\n\n* As noted previously (Module 16), **multivariate normal is not a good** description of reality in RM applications\n\n* Can involve **extensive calculations** particularly as the number of asset classes increases\n\n#### Factor-based modeling \n\n...Using PCA\n\n***PCA*** (from Module 19):\n\n* Can **reduce the computational overhead** when compared to application of the multivariate normal distribution\n\n* **Goal**: Determine only the **main factors** that contribute to deviations from the average returns\n\n    Ignore the factors with less influence\n    \n    $\\hookrightarrow$ Reducing the complexity (dimensionality) of the analysis\n\n* Particularly useful when projecting returns on `bonds` (with a variety of duration)\n\n    $\\because$ Changes in bond yields can be explained largely by shifts in just a few factors\n    \n    (i.e. level and shape of yield curve)\n\n***Steps for modeling***:\n\n* Factor-based approach has the **same simulation process** as the data-based approach, with the final steps being:\n\n6. *Derive* the **matrix of deviations**:\n\n    From the `average returns` by *deducting* the `average return` in each period for each asset class\n\n7. *Derive* the **PC** that explain a sufficiently high proportion of the deviations from average past returns\n\n8. **Project** this number of *iid* normal r.v.\n\n    Using the associated **eigenvalues as the variances**\n\n9. *Weight* these `projected series of deviations` by the *appropriate element* of the relevant **eigenvectors**\n\n10. *Add* these `weighted projected deviations` to the **expected returns** from each asset class\n\n#### Altenative Modeling Approaches\n\n* Other multivariate distribution\n\n* Combine non-normal marginal distributions using an appropriate **copula**\n\nHowever, volume of **extreme data** may be **insufficient** to form a strong view as to the best choice of distributions\n\n### Assessing Market Risk under the Basel Accords\n\nRecall from Module 5, Basel II requires banks to **hold additional capital if they invest their capital in risky assets**\n\nFor this purpose, market risk may be quantified by using an internal model of the assets to calculate a 10-day 99\\% VaR\n\n* This lead to a regulatory capital requirement under Pillar I (which is a multiple of this VaR loss)\n\n* Banks can also use standardized approach rather than internal VaR model\n\n### Expected Returns\n\nHistoric data may not give a realistic view of future experience\n\n$\\therefore$ Need to incorporate:\n\n1. **Changes in fundamentals** or other subjective viewpoints\n\n2. The effect of **tax**\n\n#### (Risk-free) Government bonds\n\nReasonable estimate of the expected return is the **gross redemption yield** on the government bond of a **similar term** as the projection period\n\n***Other relevant factors***:\n\n* **Term premium**: part of the risk premium that is a function of term\n\n    Term premium will varies by market and investors\n    \n* **Purchasing power parity**: So that for risk-free overseas government bonds, the domestic risk-free rate is suitable\n\n    In theory purchasing power parity will compensate for any difference in yield\n    \n* **Bootstrapping**: Can be used to calculate the implied forward spot yield curves based on the gross redemption yields of the bonds in a portfolio\n\n    Such detailed analysis may be spurious in the context of a stochastic modeling exercise\n    \n#### Corporate Bonds\n\nFor bonds with a **risk of default** the expected return will be higher due to the credit spread\n\nCredit spread\n\n:   Measure of the difference between the yield on a risky and a risk-free security\n\n* Typically a `corporate bond` and a `government bond` respectively\n\n* $\\Delta$ in value of an asset due to changes in the credit spread is considered a market risk by Sweeting (Others can include it in credit risk)\n\nCredit spread reflects the following factors:\n\n1. **$\\mathrm{E}[\\Pr(Default)]$** and $\\mathrm{E}[LGD]$\n\n2. Any risk premium attached to the risk of default\n\n    (i.e. **uncertainty** surrounding the expected probability of default and the expected loss given default)\n\n3. **liquidity** premium \n\n    (i.e. more difficult to sell the corporate bond when required (at an acceptable price))\n\n* Item 1. can be measured by considering default history while 2. and 3. are difficult to separate\n\nLGD\n\n:   *Residual value* of bond after default has happened\n\n* Loss will typically be partial esp. if the corporation has not gone bankrupt (e.g. but has been forced to reschedule payments)\n\n***Common measures of credit spread***\n\n1. **Nominal spread**:\n\n    Difference between the **gross redemption yields** of `risky` and `risk free` bonds\n\n2. **Static spread**:\n\n    Addition to the risk free rate at which discounted cash flows from risky bond will equate to its price\n\n    * This measures *allows for* the **term structure** of the underlying risk free rate and the term premium\n\n3. **Option-adjusted spread**:\n\n    Further adjust the discount rate through the use of stochastic modeling to **allow for any options** embedded in the bond\n\n    * The more market-consistent measure\n    \n***Observed market credit spreads*** vs ***historical default***\n\n* `Observed market credit spreads` are generally **higher** than based on `historical default` on bonds\n\n* Difference can be put down to **risk premia** in respect of:\n\n    * Higher volatility of returns relative to the risk-free asset (**credit beta**)\n\n    * Higher **uncertainty** of returns\n    \n        Particularly the possibility of **unprecedented extreme events**\n\n    * Greater **skewness** of the future returns (more significant downside) due to the possibility of default\n\n    * **Lower marketability** of corporate debt and the associated higher costs of trade\n\n    * Differences in **taxation**\n\n* Potential negative **correlation** between `credit spreads` and `interest rates` may **offset the above** to some extent for investors focusing on absolute returns (i.e. those exposed to both interest and credit risk)\n\n* When assessing credit risks, the risk premia above should be:\n\n    * Modeled as **expected volatility** in returns\n    \n    * Reflected in **liquidity planning** (rather than affect the modeled expected return)\n\nNote that not all government bonds are risk-free so it is important to clarify the reference asset\n\n#### Assets other than Bonds\n\nMethods to determine risk premium is different as other assets such as equity and property have uncertain income\n\n***Historical risk premiums***:\n\n* Calculated by: **Deducting** the *observed return* on `risk free asset` from the *observed return* on the `risky asset`, **averaging** over the periods that data is available\n\n    * Need to further adjust the average to reflect **expected future changes**\n        \n        (could be subjective or based on fundamental structural changes in the asset classes)\n\n    * For **overseas** investments:\n        \n        Important to consider volatility in each asset's `domestic currency` and allow **seperately** for **exchange rate risk** in the **correlation** calculation\n\n***CAPM***\n\nCAPM[^capm] gives a structure for analyzing risk premiums and ensuring their consistency\n\n[^capm]: $r_x = r_f + \\beta_X(r_U - r_f)$\n\n    Links the expected return $r_X$ on asset $X$ to:\n    \n    * $r_f$: Risk free rate of return\n    * $r_U$: Return on the universe of investment opportunities\n    * $\\beta_X$: The associated variances and covariances of returns\n    \n    Where:\n    \n    * $\\beta_X = \\dfrac{\\sigma_X}{\\sigma_U}\\rho_{X,U}$\n    * $\\sigma_X$, $\\sigma_U$ are the respective s.d.\n    * $\\rho_{X,U}$ is the linear correlation between the returns on $X$ and the universe of investment opportunities\n    \n### Benchmarks\n\nMarket risk should be measured relative to a suitable benchmark  \n(Typically based on `market indices` or the `investor's liabilities`)\n\n***Features*** of a good benchmark\n\n* **Unambiguous**\n\n* **Investable**\n\n* **Tractable**\n\n* Measurable on a **reasonably frequent** basis\n\n* **Appropriate**\n\n    (e.g. to the investor's objectives)\n\n* **Reflective of current investment opinion** (positive, negative, neutral)\n\n* **Specified in advance**\n\nMight be appropriate to ***measure against*** benchmark that:\n\n* Contains a high proportion of the assets held in the portfolio\n\n    (i.e. **Has similar assets**)\n\n* Has a similar **investment style** (growth or value, etc)\n\n* Has a **low turnover constituents**\n\n* Has **investible position sizes**\n\n* **Behaves in a similar way** to the portfolio  \n\n    (i.e. shows a strong (+) correlation between portfolio return ($r_X$) and the benchmark return ($r_B$) in XS of the market return ($r_U$))  \n\n    (i.e. $\\rho(r_X - r_U, r_B - r_U) \\gg 0$)\n\n* Has low correlation between the **difference** of the {`portfolio return` and the `benchmark return` }and {`benchmark return` and the `market return`}\n  \n    (i.e. $\\rho(r_X - r_B, r_B - r_U) \\approx 0$)\n\nIf the **liabilities benchmark** is used:\n\n* Reference point is often a set of cashflows (or notional assets) that represent the actual (uncertain) liabilities\n\n    (i.e. **liabilities cash flow**)\n\nRisks and return can both be defined and measured with reference to the chosen benchmark(s)\n\n* **Strategic risk**\n\n    Risk of poor performance of the benchmark against which the manager's performance will be judged (the `strategic benchmark`) relative to the `liability-based benchmark`\n\n* **Active risk**\n\n    Risk of poor performance of the manager's `actual portfolio` relative to the `manager's (strategic) benchmark`\n\n* **Active return**\n\n    Difference between the return on the `actual (active) portfolio` and the return on the `manager's (strategic) benchmark`\n\n## Assessing Interest Rate Risk\n\nBasic 1-factor approaches are useful for simulating short-term, single interest rates\n\nNeed more **complex models** for modeling: **multiple points on a yield curve** or **changes to the shape of a yield curve**\n\n**Exam Note**:\n\n* Need to be familiar with manipulating interest rates (e.g. forward rates and yield curves)\n\n* See Sweeting 14.3.1 and 14.3.2 for revision\n\n### Two-factor Models\n\n***Brennan-Schwartz*** model\n\n* Considers $\\Delta$ in `spot rates` at **2 maturities**\n\n    e.g. short term ($r_{1,t}$) and long-term ($r_{2,t}$) at time $t$\n\n    $\\Delta r_{1,t} = [\\alpha_a + \\beta_1(r_{2,t-1} - r_{1,t-1})] \\Delta t + r_{1,t-1}\\epsilon_{1,t}$\n\n    $\\Delta r_{2,t} = [(\\alpha_2 + \\beta_2r_{1,t-1} - \\gamma_2r_{2,t-1}] \\Delta t + r_{2,t-1}\\epsilon_{2,t}$\n    \n***Model assumptions***\n\n* $\\Delta$ in `short-term rates` *vary in line* with the **steepness** of the `yield curve`\n    \n    (the differential between long and short term rates)\n\n    i.e. $\\alpha_1 + \\beta_1(r_{2,t-1}-r_{1,t-1})$ for some $\\alpha_1$ and $\\beta_1$\n\n* **Volatility** of `short term rates` *varies* $\\propto$ the **most recent level** of `short term rates`\n\n    * i.e. $\\epsilon_{1,t} r_{1,t-1}$\n    \n* $\\Delta$ in `long term rates` *vary* $\\propto$ the **square of the level** of `long term rates`\n\n    (i.e. $\\gamma_2 r^2_{2,t-1}$ for some $\\gamma_2$) \n    \n    But are also *influenced by* the `short-term rates` through the **product term** $\\beta_2 r_{1,t-1}r_{2,t-1}$\n    \n* **Volatility** of `long term rates` *varies* $\\propto$ the **level** of `long term rates`\n\n    * i.e. $\\epsilon_{2,t} r_{2,t-1}$\n\n***Limitations***:\n\n* Constraint to 2 factors\n\n* Difficult to select the appropriate parameters\n\n### PCA Approach\n\nPCA can be applied to `gross redemption yields` (or log to avoid negatives), `forward yields` or `bond prices` to **determine the main factors that contribute to changes**\n\nFor `GRYs` the process is similar to the market risk:\n\n1. Pick **frequency**\n\n2. Pick **time-frame** of historical data to use\n\n3. Take the GRYs for bonds of **different durations** and calculate the `average interest rate` for the series\n\n4. **Deduct** the `average interest rate` (to derive the deviation)\n\nA set of factors is chosen and weighted, then projected using independent r.v. (normal) to produce expected interest rates for each term\n\nFor `bond prices` ($p_t$):\n\n1. First calculate **log returns** $\\ln (p_t \\big/ p_{t-1})$\n\n2. Then the **deviations** from average log-returns are analyzed\n\n## Assessing Exchange Rate Risk\n\nFX risk shares similarities to **interest rate** risk\n\n* Can be modeled in terms of the `returns on short-term interest-bearing deposits` **denominated in different currencies**\n\n* FX rates reflect **different interest rates** and the **expectation** of `appreciation` or `depreciation` of the currency\n\n**FX risk can be hedged** away using `currency forward agreements` (See Module 27), hence there is no additional currency return to be gained (or modeled) if working in a single denomination\n\n***No-arbitrage argument***:\n\n$\\dfrac{e_0}{e_t}(1+r_{Y,t}) = 1 + r_{X,t}$\n\n* $r_{X,t}$ and $r_{Y,t}$ are the annual effective spot interest rates in 2 countries at time $t$\n\n* $e_t$ is the expected FX rate at time $t$\n\n## Contagion/ Systemic Risks\n\n***Contagion risks**\n\n* Usually seen as an **extension of market risk**\n\n    Can also apply to other risk (e.g. credit): Where the default of one org can cause its creditors and supplier to experience financial difficulties\n\n* Can be modeled as the **interaction** between different `financial series`\n\n    * Certain series may be **linked for extreme negative values**\n\n    * The increase level of dependence suggest we should **use copula**\n\n***Approaches to modeling contagion risks***\n\n* **Single financial series**\n\n    Contagion can be considered a **feedback risk**  \n\n    (i.e. there is some serial correlation that can be modeled)\n\n    However, that would presents an arbitrage opportunity which in theory should be eliminated by arbitrageurs \n    \n    $\\therefore$ such serial correlation effects are usually ignored when modeling\n\n* **Between related financial series**\n\n    Fitting a *t*-copula using correlation parameter $\\rho$ that is **situation dependent**\n\n    i.e. $\\rho = \\rho_0 + D_1 \\rho_1 + D_2 \\rho_2$\n\n    * $\\rho_0$:\n    \n        Normal level of dependency \n    \n    * $\\rho_1$ and $\\rho_2$:\n    \n        Additional dependency in different states\n\n    * $D_i$:\n    \n        States indicators\n        \n        e.g. $D_1 = 1$ during financial crisis and 0 otherwise; $D_2=1$ in the aftermath of a financial crisis and 0 otherwise\n    \n    ",
