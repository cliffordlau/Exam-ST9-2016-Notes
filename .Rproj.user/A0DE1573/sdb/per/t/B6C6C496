We can model the tail by modeling the full distribution but need make sure the **form of the distribution is correct in the tails**\n\n    * Use data from both stressed and non-stressed periods to fit the distribution\n    \n    * Financial data is typically more **leptokurtic** (narrow peak and fat tail)\n    \n        $\\therefore$ Extreme values for equity occur more frequently than predicted with a normal distribution\n    \n        * A better distribution would be *t* distribution\n\n    **Reasons for fat tails** in financial data\n\n    * **Heteroscedastic** returns (i.e. volatility varies over time)\n    \n    * Innovation in a heteroscedastic model are best modeled using a fat tailed distribution\n\n2. **Fitting the tail**\n\n    * Difficult since paramter estimates are **heavily influenced** by the main bulk of the data in the **middle of the distribution**\n    \n    * This is where extreme value theory comes can help\n    \n## Extreme Value Theory\n\n### Definition of Extreme\n\n1. Consider an extreme value as the **maximum value in a set** of $n$ losses\n\n    **Block maximum**\n    \n    e.g. $X_M = max(X_1,X_2,...,X_n)$\n\n2. Consider all losses that exceed a certain **threshold** as being extreme\n\n### Limiting Behaviour\n\nFor **losses that have typical sizes** (values from the central part of the distribution) we can use **CLT**:\n\n* ***CLT***:\n\n    Standardized value of the average loss $\\dfrac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}$ can be approximated using a normal distribution\n    \n      * $\\bar{X}$ is the mean of the $n$ samples from a distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma$\n    \n* Need similar method to estimate the behavior of the extreme values in the tail of the distribution\n\n***Extreme value theory***:\n\n* Has the 2 main results below (maxima and threshold exceedances)\n\n* Key idea is that there are certain families **of distributions** (`Generalized Extreme Value` and `Generalized Pareto`) that **describe the behavior of the tails** of many distributions\n\n#### Maxima\n\n$X_M = max(X_1, X_2,...,X_n)$\n\n* Block maxima\n\n* The distribution of $X_M$ is approximately described by the **Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) family** of distributions\n\n    * If $n$ is sufficiently large\n\n* If we look at a number of such blocks then these maxima can be standardized in a similar way\n\n    i.e. We calculate expressions of the form $\\dfrac{X_M - \\alpha_n}{\\beta_n}$\n    \n* Can approximate by an extreme value distribution\n\n#### Threshold Exceedances\n\n$\\Pr(X>x+u \\mid X>u)$\n\n* The tail of the distribution above a threshold\n\n* Can be approximated, for large values of $u$ by the **Generalized Pareto Distribution** (GPD)\n\n* Consider the expected size of losses that exceed a certain thresholds\n\n## Generalized Extreme Value Distribution\n\nGeneralized Extreme Value family of distributions are important in the study of limiting behavior of sample extremes\n\n### Extreme Values Theorem (EVT)\n\n***Distribution*** of $X_M$\n\n* $X_M = max(X_1, X_2,...,X_n)$ where each $X_i$ is an observed loss\n\n* If losses are *iid* with CDF $F$:\n\n    $\\begin{align}\n      P(X_M \\leq x) &= P(X_1 \\leq x, X_2 \\leq x, ..., X_n \\leq x) \\\\\n      &= P(X_1\\leq x)P(X_2\\leq x)...P(X_n \\leq x) \\\\\n      &= \\left[ P(X_1\\leq x) \\right]^n \\\\\n      &= \\left[ F(x) \\right]^n \\\\\n      &= F^n (x)\\\\\n    \\end{align}$\n\n* Standardized for a sequence of **real constants**\n\n    $\\beta_1,...,\\beta_n > 0$\n    \n    $\\alpha_1,...,\\alpha_n$\n    \n* Consider the limit as $n$ increases:\n\n    Limiting distribution $H(x)$\n\n    $H(x) = \\lim \\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P \\left(\\dfrac{X_M -

Data divided into $m$ blocks of size $n$\n\n    ii. Maximum of the $j$^th^ block to be $M_{nj}$ (i.e. the maximum data are $M_{n1},...,M_{nm}$)\n\n2.

A lot of **data (information) is lost**\n    \n    Everything apart from the maxima in each block is effectively ignored\n    \n2. Choice of **block size** can be subjective\n\n    Compromise between `granularity` (1-in-100 vs 1-in-1000) and `parameter uncertainty`\n    \n## Generalized Pareto Distribution\n\nConsider all claim values **exceed some threshold** as extreme values\n\n* For large samples, the distribution of these extreme values **converges** to the **generalized Pareto distribution** (GPD)\n\n* Need to **select a suitably high threshold** to fit the GPD\n\n### Threshold Exceedances\n\n***Excess distribution over the threshold u*** $F_u(x)$\n\n* *Let* $X$ be a r.v. with distribution $F$\n\n    $F_u(x) = P(X -

u)I(X_i>u)}{\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^N I(X_i>u)}$\n\n* Calculated for each of the $N$ observed data points by setting $u=X_i$ for $i=1,...,N$\n\n***Mean XS plot***\n\nEach of the observed losses has been treated as a **potential threshold** (on the *x-axis*) and the **mean XS loss** based on that threshold has been calculated and plotted (*y-axis*)\n\n![](figures/figure-18.21.png)\n\n***Example***\n\nMean XS function for $X\\sim Exp(\\lambda)$\n\n$\\begin{align}\n  F_u(x) &= P(X \\leq x + u \\mid x >u) & \\\\\n  &= P(X \\leq x) & \\text{Since memoriness} \\\\\n  &= F(x)\\\\\n\\end{align}$\n\nSo the XS distribution is also $Exp(\\lambda)$ and the mean XS function is $e(u) = \\dfrac{1}{\\lambda}$, which is independent of $u$\n\n### Fitting a GPD\n\nNeed to **decide on the threshold** $u$, above which we will approximate the underlying distribution with the GPD\n\n* Should consider the **context** when picking $u$\n\n    e.g. XS over which a reinsurer might be liable to cover\n\n    Typically $u$ is around the 90-95^th^ percentile of the full distribution\n\n***Consideration*** for choosing threshold $u$\n\n* *Trade off* between:\n\n    **Quality of the approximation** to the GPD (good for high $u$)\n    \n    *vs*\n    \n    **level of bias** in the fit we achieve (good for low $u$)\n\n* For **high value** for $u$\n\n    * The **asymptotic properties apply more accurately** (as we are closer to $\\infty$)\n\n    * But have **few data values to work** with (estimates may be unreliable)\n\nRecall ([asymptotic property](#asy-prop)):\n\n* When maxima of a dist^n^ ($M_{ni}$) converge to a GEV, then the XS dist^n^ ($F_u(x)$) converge to GPD w/ equivalent $\\gamma$\n\n* Under the above circumstances $e(u)$ will become a **linear function** of $u$\n\n    $\\therefore$ If we **plot** $e(u)$ *against* $u$ we should see linearity appear for higher values of $u$\n\n    * Slope of this line is related to $\\gamma$\n    \n        $\\therefore$ facilitating the **fitting of a GPD** distribution to the **empirical XS distribution**\n\nSo to ***select a suitable threshold***\n\n* We are looking for the **mean XS** to be **linear** to $u$\n\n* **Graphical test** for tail behavior can then be based on the empirical mean XS function\n\n* Look at the slope of the line\n\n    * Slop upwards $\\Rightarrow$ $\\gamma$ is (+)\n    \n    * Slop downwards $\\Rightarrow$ $\\gamma$ is (-)\n\nRecall:\n\n* In the $Exp(\\lambda)$ example above, the mean XS function was constant (i.e. slope was 0)\n\n* But for other distributions the mean XS function will slope upwards if $\\gamma$ is (+) and downwards if $\\gamma$ is (-)\n\n***Mean XS simulations***\n\nBelow is a selection of mean XS loss plots from simulation\n\n* Each is based on the same underlying $Exp(\\lambda)$ distribution\n\nThere is a large random element to the plots' appearance and many of them are far from horizontal (theoretically the slope should be 0)\n\nTherefore selecting a suitable threshold (and value of $\\gamma$) is very difficult\n\n![](figures/figure-18.22.png)\n\n***Example***\n\nBased on the sample mean XS plot (from the mean XS function section)\n\nBelow shows the **different possibilities for choosing** the threshold\n\n![](figures/figure-18.23.png)\n\n1. Longest (solid) line is the least squares linear regression on the whole data set\n\n2. Shorter (dotted) line is a regression on just the tail (above 100,000)\n\n3. Shortest (dashed) line is a regression on the tail (above 100,000) excluding the final five points\n\nThis again, shows the **subjectivity** in the fitting process\n\n#### Parameterization\n\nAbove the chosen threshold, we can fit a GPD by using standard techniques (e.g. `MLE`, `Method of moments`) to calculate $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$\n\n***MLE Example***\n\n* Data before cut off $X = \\{X_1,...,X_n\\}$ is assumed to be *iid*\n\n* $Y_j = X_j - u$ is the amount of the XS loss when the threshold is exceeded\n\n    * *Assume* $Y_j$ follow a GPD, not the $X_j$\n\n* Assume a random number of observations $N_u$ exceed the threshold\n\n* If we attempt to fit a GPD with parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ and PDF $g(x)$ to the data $(Y_1, Y_2, ...,Y_n)$ then we get the following log-likelihood function:\n\n    $\\ln \\left( L(\\gamma,\\beta; Y) \\right) = \\sum \\limits_{j=1}^{N_u} \\ln \\left( g(Y_j) \\right)$\n\n**Domain** of valid values for $x$ will **depend*8 on the values of the parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$",
