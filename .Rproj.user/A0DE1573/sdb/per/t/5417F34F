Main sources of uncertainty when using models in ERM\n\n    * See Module 21 Section \"Sources of uncertainty\"\n    \n    * Parameter uncertainty, model uncertainty and stochastic uncertainty\n    \n2. List the steps involved in developing and applying a model\n\n    * See Module 21 Section \"Modeling Process\"\n    \n3. List the features of the returns on individual equities that have been suggested by time series analyses\n\n    * See Module 22 Section \"Features of Equity Market Returns\"\n    \n4. List the factors which are reflected in a credit spread and state the 3 most common measures of credit spread\n\n    * See Module 22 Section \"Corporate Bonds\"\n    \n5. Explain how the op-risk capital can be calculate under the following models\n\n    i. Implied capital model\n    \n        See Module 24 Section \"Top-down Models\"\n    \n    ii. Income volatility model\n    \n        See Module 24 Section \"Top-down Models\"\n        \n    iii. Capital asset pricing model\n    \n        See Module 24 Section \"Top-down Models\"\n        \n6. Advice on actively managing operational risk in a formal way\n\n    i. Reasons why the company's directors might have become interested in op-risk management\n    \n        See Module 24 Section \"Need to Assess Op-Risk\" Point 1-5\n        \n    ii. Advantages of a more formal approach to op-risk\n    \n        See Module 24 Section \"Need to Assess Op-Risk\" Point 6-8\n    \n    iii. Benefits that the directors could expect to see if they enforce an effective op-risk management process\n    \n        See Module 24 Section \"Need to Assess Op-Risk\" Benfits bullet points\n        \n7. More op-risk related questions\n\n    i. Distinguish between bottom-up and top-down approaches for op-risk\n    \n        **Top-down**: The company as a whole is considered\n        \n        * Use readily available data and fairly simple calculations to give a general picture of the op-risk\n        \n        **Bottom-up**\n        \n        * Each activity of the company is considered first and then the results are aggregated\n        \n    ii. Describe bottom-up approaches to assess op-risk\n    \n        * See Module 24 Section \"Bottom up models\" for the following key points\n        \n        * Model frequency and severity of day-to-day op-risk losses\n        \n        * Insufficient data so need to suppliment with external data\n        \n        * If there is sufficient data, use Monte Carlo\n        \n        * Model needs to cope well with the outer tail (e.g. EVT) but is not widely use due to limitation on internal data\n        \n        * Simpler approach can be used that assumes losses are related to the volume of transactions\n        \n        * Bottom up includes statistical and scenario analysis\n        \n    iii. State 4 top-down models that can be used in assessing operational risk\n    \n        * See Module 24 Section \"Top-down Models\"\n        \n    iv. Main problems with the top-down models\n    \n        * All these models fail to capture successfully low probability, high consequence risk events\n        \n        * Do not consider specific individual activities / incidents\n        \n        * No assessment of the effect of individual events, so these models do not help in minimizing future losses by improving procedures in this area\n        \n8. CAPM: risk free = 2%, market risk premium = 4%, $\\beta$ = 1.25\n\n    i. Expected return from the market = 2% + 4% = 6%\n    \n    ii. Expected return from shares in company = 2% + 1.25 $\\times$ 4% = 7%\n    \n    iii. Cost of capital used by management in evaluting projects\n    \n        Should be 7% to meet investors expectations\n        \n        This assumes no tax is payable, and that a project that yields a return of 7% would offer the same return to equity shareholders\n        \n9. Extreme events\n\n    i. Examples of extreme events\n    \n        See Module 20 Section \"Low Freq/ High Sev Events\"\n        \n    ii. Importance to consider extreme events separately from other types in ERM\n    \n        See Module 20 Section \"Low Freq/ High Sev Events\"\n        \n10. Generalized Extreme Value distribution\n\n    i. Describe the GEV distribution\n    \n        See Module 20 Section \"GEV Distribution\"\n        \n        * The distribution of the maximum value $X_M$ in a sample on $n$ *iid* r.v. when $n \\rightarrow \\infty$\n        \n        * Discuss the different parameters and the different classes corresponding to each $\\gamma$\n        \n    ii. Describe how GEV can be used to model extreme events in ERM\n    \n        See Module 20 Section \"Generalized Extreme Value Distribution\n\"\n        \n        Extreme loss events correspond to the maximum values experienced over a period, so we might expect them to conform to the GEV distribution\n        \n        We can calculate the maximum loss event from past data by dividing it into blocks and calculating the maximum within each block\n        \n        We can do it 2 ways (max in a block or threshold)\n        \n        Estimate the parameters with MLE or moments\n        \n        Use the fitting distribution for percentiles, means and variances\n        \n    iii. Alternate approach to the GEV\n    \n        Theshold approach with GPD\n        \n        See Module 20 Section \"Generalized Pareto Distribution\"\n        \n11. Mean excess function\n\n    i. Define the mean excess function\n    \n        See Module 20 Section \"Mean XS Function\"\n        \n    ii. Formula for mean XS loss for exponential with mean $1 / \\lambda$\n    \n        If $X$ has exponential with mean $1 / \\lambda$:\n        \n        $\\Pr(X >u) = \\int \\limits_u^{\\infty} \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x} dx = e^{-\\lambda u}$\n        The conditional probabilities:\n        \n        $\\begin{align}\n          \\Pr(X > x + u \\mid X >u ) &= \\dfrac{\\Pr(X > x + u \\& X > u)}{\\Pr(X > u)} \\\\\n          &= \\dfrac{\\Pr(X > x +u )}{\\Pr(X>u)} \\\\\n          &= \\dfrac{e^{-\\lambda(x+u)}}{e^{-\\lambda u}} \\\\\n          &= e^{-\\lambda x} \\\\\n        \\end{align}$\n        \n        Therefore:\n        \n        $\\Pr(X - u \\leq x \\mid X > u) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x}$\n        \n        So the mean XS loss function has a constant value $e(u) = \\dfrac{1}{\\lambda}$\n        \n    iii. Shapes of the mean XS loss function for different loss distribution\n    \n        a. Exponential\n        \n            Constant, so graph would be horizontal\n            \n        b. Normal\n            \n            Symmetrical and tails off quicker than exponential on the right handside\n            \n            Mean XS will tail off as the threshold increases (but always remains positive)\n            \n        c. Uniform\n        \n            Has finite upper limit\n            \n            Once threshold hits the limit, the XS will always be 0\n            \n            Before this point, the mean excess decrease linearly\n            \n12. Reasons why op-risk might NOT be best measured simply as a % of revenue\n\n    See Module 24 Section \"Factor-based models\"\n    \n13. 1 year term insurance contracts with sum insured of $350,000 to a group of 100 lives\n\n    a. Probability it will pay out $1m or more for lives aged 50 where $q_{50} = 0.002$\n    \n        Need at least 3 deaths during the year $Binomial(100, q_x)$\n        \n        $1 - (1-q_x)^{100} + {{100}\\choose{1}} q_x(1-q_x)^{99} - {{100}\\choose{2}} (q_X)^2 (1-q_x)^{98}$ \n        \n        Just plug and play\n        \n    b. For $q_{60}$ Just plug the above\n    \n    * This example shows that $q_{60} \\gg q_{50}$, so a 1% change in all mortality rates has a greater effect for higher ages\n    \n        Hence the volatility risk is much higher for the older lives in (b)\n        \n## Applied Calculation Questions\n\n## Exam Style Questions",
