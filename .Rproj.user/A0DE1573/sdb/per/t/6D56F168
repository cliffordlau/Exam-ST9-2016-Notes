Look at how the overall strategy of a company may be influenced by risks, and how implementation of RM control cycles can enable it to deal appropriately with such risks\n\n2. Consider how RM might be organized within a hierarchical role-based structure\n\n## Corporate Strategy\n\nThe degrees to which `risks` are **embraced** or **mitigated** forms an important part of the overall **corporate strategy**\n\n***Corporate Strategy***\n\n* Involves *assessing* its `value chain`, `core competencies` and the `risk/return economies` of the overall business to decide **where in the value chain it ought to compete**\n\n* Strategy covers a wide range of different corporate decisions\n\n    (e.g. `sales growth`, `product choices`,`distribution`, `target markets` etc)\n\n***Where RM comes into play***\n\n* Risk **organiztion**, **retention**, and **transfer** can form *part of* the **overall business strategy** of the organization even thought they have a transactional context\n\n* The degree to which risks are embraced or mitigated can be a key part of the overall strategy above, e.g.:\n\n    * How much risky products to undertake\n    * How much risk transfer or hedging to use\n    * Managing the company's borrowing and gearing (leverage) ratio\n\n***Problem with taking on too much risk***\n\nCompanies that takes on and retain more risk can achieve higher return but might find themselves **in difficulties more often**\n\n* Problems in one area can quickly **disrupt operations** in other areas, reducing future profits further\n\n* Company that is in difficulty may take decisions that **adversely affect some stakeholders**  \n$\\hookrightarrow$ Can reduce the profitability and value of the company\n\n***Cost of financial distress***\n\n* Encourage management to take **actions that conflict** with the `interest of other stakeholders`, e.g.:\n    \n    * Produce poor quality goods\n    \n    * Operating in unsafe environment \n    \n    * Cut back on long term investment\n    \n    * Exiting promising LoB\n    \n    * Liquidating operations that was adequate\n\n* **Volatility in earnings** can also *affect* the share price and ability to take advantage of **tax credits**\n\n***Companies that can benefit from active RM***\n\nProbability of financial distress can directly affect the value of a company\n\nCompanies that benefit most from active RM:\n\n* Offer products with high added value (e.g. having high production quality)\n\n* Offer products for which there are high costs of switching to another line\n\n* Offer products for which the value to customers depends on complementary services or products supplied by other independent companies\n\n* Have high sales growth opportunities\n\n***Managing uncertainty***: **Horizon Scanning** and **Flexibility**\n\nAttention is increasingly being paid to the management of uncertainty in the widest sense\n\n* World is highly unpredictable\n* Unexpected pressures may develop quite suddenly and have major impacts on organizations\n\n**Systematic management of corporate uncertainty** is becoming more prevalent\n\n1. Techniques (horizon scanning) to ensure potential problems are spotted early so that appropriate mitigating actions can be taken\n    \n    * **Horizon scanning**:\n\n        Knowledge gathering to try to spot pressures at the earliest opportunity and to give the organization **time to adapt**\n\n2. Embedding **resilience** and **flexibility** into corporate structures\n    \n    * Help deal with problems that aren't spotted sufficiently early to facilitate appropriate mitigation\n    \n    * Since adaptation is not always possible, some organizations are looking strategically at structural change so they become more flexible and can better withstand pressures when they arise\n    \n    * Particularly applies to **financial robustness** and flexibility\n    \n    * **Operational flexibility** examples:\n    \n        * Increase use of outsourcing\n    \n        * Spread operations over various sites/countries\n    \n        * Shift distribution channels\n    \n        * Move away from grouping individuals into specialist teams and operating more using multi-discipline project teams\n        \n## Risk Management Control Cycles\n\n**Control Cycle**:\n\n* One way of developing and implementing strategies to manage risk\n* The cycle should be capable of taking account of changes in risk\n\nWill discuss key points about control cycles from a number of different sources\n\nProcess and cycles are typically developed to meet an organization's specific needs (so no single right answer)\n\n### Actuarial Control Cycle\n\n![](figures/figure-08.01.png)\n\nApplying the actuarial control cycle to risk management to get the ERM process\n\n### ERM Process\n\n![](figures/figure-08.02.png)\n\nThe cyclical structure of the process through analysis (+ identification of risk), quantification, management, monitoring, and modification is directly applicable to ERM\n\nAll the key components are discussed in details in later modules\n\nNeed **well defined risk metrics** and **risk reporting** systems to ensure the the **monitoring** stage is *robust*\n\n## Organizational Structures Supporting ERM\n\n### 3 Lines of Defence\n\n1. **Line management staff in the BU**\n    \n    * Accountable for *measuring* and *managing* risk in `individual BUs` on a **daily basis**\n    \n    * Should be in *line with* the company's stated `risk appetite` and `risk policies`\n\n2. **CRO and risk management team**\n  \n    * **Centralized** RM function and compliance team\n  \n    * Accountable for **establishing** `risk and compliance programs` and `policies`\n  \n    * **Supporting and monitoring** the `line management` and **reporting** to the `Board`\n\n3. **Board and audit function**\n  \n    * *Accountable* for **effective governance** of the `RM process`, **setting RM strategy**, **approving policies**, and **ensuring that ERM is effective**\n    \nThe Risk Management Function (RMF) doesn't have to be one department\n\n* Can be a virtual team comprising distinct functions from different parts of the business\n* But it's best to have a Central Risk Function CRF headed by a CRO",
