Notional approach\n2. Factor sensitivity approach\n3. Scenario sensitivity approach\n\n### Notional Approach\n\nBroad-brush risk measures\n\n1. *Apply* **risk weighting** to the **market value of assets**\n    \n    Different weights for different asset classes\n    \n    Weights $\\leq$ 100%\n\n2. Sum total to **compare** to the **value of liabilities** to determine a notional (\"risk-adjusted\") financial position\n\n***Advantage***:\n\n* **Simple** to *implement* and *interpret* across a divers range of org.\n\n***Disadvantages***:\n\n* Potential undesirable use of a \"catch all\" weighting for (heterogeneous) **undefined asset class**\n\n* Possible **distortions to the market** caused by increased demand for asset classes\n\n* **Treating short positions as if they where the exact opposite** of the equivalent long position (in practice they might affect the capital requirements to different extents)\n\n* *Non allowance* for **concentration risk**\n    \n    * Weight is applied to the asset class and **doesn't distinguish between securities**\n\n* **Probability of the changes** considered (in the values of assets and liabilities) is **not quantified**\n\n### Factor Sensitivity Approach\n\nDetermines the degree to which an org's *financial position* (e.g. solvency) is affected by the impact that **change in a single underlying risk factor** (e.g. short term interest rates) has on the *value of assets and liabilities*\n\n***Advantage***:\n\n* Increased **understanding of the drivers** of risk\n\n***Disadvantage***:\n\n* Not assessing **wider range of risks** (since it focus on a single risk factor)\n\n* Being **difficult to aggregate** over different risk factors\n\n* **Probability of the changes** considered (in the values of assets and/or liabilities) is **not quantified**\n\n### Scenario Sensitivity Approach\n\nSimilar to factor sensitivity\n\n* Consider the effect of changing **a set of factors** (in a consistent way)\n\n    e.g. Recession: `low interest rate` + `low inflation` + `depressed equity returns`\n\n***Disadvantage***:\n\n* **Probability of the changes** considered (in the values of assets and liability) is **not quantified**\n\n## Probabilistic Approaches\n\n**Probablistic** measures:  \n*(<span style=\"color:green\">Pros</span>)* Potentially more accurate;  \n*(<span style=\"color:red\">Cons</span>)* More complex (greater model risk);  \n*(<span style=\"color:red\">Cons</span>)* Can imply inappropriate levels of confidence (esp. with tail risk estimation)\n\n1. Deviation (incl. volatility)\n2. Value at Risk\n3. Probability of ruin\n4. Tail Value at Risk (Conditional Value at Risk)\n5. Expected shortfall\n\n### Deviation\n\n1. Standard deviation\n\n2. Tracking Error\n\n#### Standard Deviation\n\nDeviation measured **from the mean**\n\n$SD = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{T}\\sum \\limits_{t=1}^T (r_{X,t} - \\mu)^2}$\n\n* where $\\mu = \\sum \\limits_{t=1}^T \\frac{1}{T}r_{X,t}$\n\n* For return $r_{X,t}$ on portfolio $X$ in time period $t$\n\n* $SD$ measured over $T$ time period\n\n#### Tracking Error\n\nDeviation measured **relative to a benchmark** other than the mean\n\n$TE = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{T}\\sum \\limits_{t=1}^T(r_{X,t}-r_{B,t})^2}$\n\n* For return on the benchmark portfolio ($B$) in time period $t$ is $r_{B,t}$\n\n* Tracking error measured over $T$ time period\n\n#### Common applications\n\n***Returns on a portfolio of assets***:\n\n* Retrospectively (**ex post**):  \n\n    Calculating past deviations based on actual historic asset allocations\n\n* Prospectively (**en ante**):  \n\n    Based on current asset allocations but using either:\n    \n    * Observed **historic covariances** of the returns on different asset classes (semi prospectively)\n    \n    * Estimated **future covariances** (fully prospectively)\n    \n***Mean-variance portfolio theory***:\n\n* Mean variance portfolio theory assumes that the s.d. of portfolio return is the only risk considered by investors (build efficient frontier based on $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$)\n\n***Risk and return of active investment strategy***:\n\n* Judging the investment return by *referencing* what would have been achieved by passive investment in a benchmark portfolio\n\n* Tracking error measure the **risk inherent in an active investment strategy**\n\n* [Information ratio](#info-ratio)\n\n#### Information Ratio {#info-ratio}\n\nA risk-adjusted return measure\n\n* Considers the size of the **average XS return** (aka average active return) as a *proportion* of the risk exposure as measured by **tracking error**\n\n* Useful for rankings as it is **dimensionless** (no units)\n\n***Ex post information ratio***\n\n* Using **past returns** on the `actual` and `benchmark` portfolios\n\n* $IR = \\dfrac{\\text{XS Return}}{\\text{Tracking Error}}  = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{1}{T}\\sum \\limits_{t=1}^T(r_{X,t} - r_{B,t})}{\\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{T}\\sum \\limits_{t=1}^T(r_{X,t} - r_{B,t})^2}}$\n\n***Ex ante information ratio***\n\n* Requires calculation of the potential **prospective** `average XS return` and `tracking errors`\n\n* Can use a factor based stochastic model\n\n#### Pros and Cons\n\n***Advantages***\n\n* **Simplicity** of calculation\n\n* **Applicability** to a wide range of financial risks\n\n* **Can be aggregated** given correlations\n\n    $\\mathrm{Var}(aX + bY) = a^2\\mathrm{Var}(X) + b^2\\mathrm{Var}(Y) + 2ab\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)$\n\n***Disadvantages***\n\n* Difficult in **interpreting comparisons** other than in terms of simple ranking\n\n* Potentially **misleading** if the **underlying distribution is skewed**\n\n* Do not focus on **tail risk**\n\n    Underestimates tail risk if the underlying distribution is leptokurtic (thick tail)\n\n* **Aggregations** of deviations **can be misleading**  \n(e.g. if the component distributions are not normally distributed)\n\n### Value at Risk (VaR)\n\n$\\mathrm{VaR}_{\\alpha} = \\inf \\left \\{ l \\in \\mathbb{R} : \\Pr(L>l) \\leq 1 - \\alpha \\right\\}$\n\n* Maximum loss which is not exceed with a given high probability ($\\alpha$) over a given time period\n\n* Side note: $\\{x : P(x)\\}$ means the set of all x for which $P(x)$ is true; $\\inf$ basically means the largest element of the set\n\n***Time horizon selection***:\n\n* Chosen to comply with any contractual and legislative **constraints**, or\n\n* **Liquidity** considerations\n\n* Typically a **short period** of time as the portfolio is usually only stable over short period (typically 1 yr for insurance and 1 day for banks)\n\n**Confidence level selection**:\n\n* High confidence level is typically used for capital adequacy purposes\n\n    e.g. 99% over 10 days for Basel\n\n* Typically consider multiple confidence level\n\n***Advantages***\n\n* **Simplicity** of its expression\n\n* **Intelligibility** of its **unit**\n\n* **Applicable to all** types of risks\n\n    Applicable over all sources of risk (easy comparison between risk)\n\n* **Easy to translation** into a risk **benchmark** (e.g. risk limit)\n\n***Disadvantages***\n\n* Gives **no indication** of the distribution of **losses XS VaR**\n\n* Can **underestimate asymmetric** and fat tail risk\n\n* Can be very **sensitive** to the `choices of data`, `parameters` (e.g. $\\alpha$, time horizon) and `assumptions`\n\n* Not a coherent risk measure (**not sub-additive**)\n\n* Can **encourage \"herding\"** if used in regulation $\\Rightarrow$ increasing systemic risk\n\n#### Empirical Approach\n\nGiven the following: \n\n* Value $X_t$ of portfolio $X$ at time $t$\n\n* Loss in period $t$ for portfolio $X$ = $-(X_t - X_{t-1})$\n\n* Losses observed over a total of $T$ periods are ranked from smallest ($L_{X,1}$) to largest ($L_{X,T}$)\n\n$VaR_{\\alpha} = \n  \\begin{cases} \n      L_{X, (T \\times \\alpha)} & \\text{if } T \\times \\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\\\\n      \\left[(T \\times \\alpha) - t_- \\right] L_{X,t_+} + \\left[t_+ - (T \\times \\alpha)\\right]L_{X,t_-} & \\text{else} \\\\\n  \\end{cases}$\n  \n* Calculate with linear interpolation for the 2^nd^ case\n* $t_-$ and $t_+$ are the integers immediately either side of $T \\times \\alpha$\n\n***Advantages***\n\n* Simplicity\n\n* No requirement to specify the distribution of returns\n\n* Realism, focuses on the largest market movements observed\n\n***Disadvantages***\n\n* Reliance on past data having captured all possible future scenarios\n\n* Implies past data is indicative of future experience\n\n* Does not facilitate stress or scenario testing\n\n* Practical difficulties and limitations of interpolation\n\n#### Parametric Approach\n\nGiven the following:\n\n* Assumes that losses follow some specified statistical distribution\n\n* Let $L$ be a r.v. that represents loss on a portfolio\n\n* $F(x) = \\Pr(L\\leq x)$ is the CDF of $L$\n\n$VaR_{\\alpha} = F^{-1}(\\alpha)$\n\n* e.g. if $L \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ then $VaR_{\\alpha} = \\mu + \\sigma \\times \\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha)$\n\n***Parametization***\n\n* Past data\n\n* Implied future volatility from **option prices**\n\n* For very short time horizon **can assume 0 return** ($\\mu = 0$)\n\n* For long time horizon better to define losses w.r.t to log asset value: $L_{X,t} = -( \\ln X_t - \\ln X_{t-1}) = - r_{X,t}$\n\n    * Express in terms of return rather than loss\n\n***Advantages***\n\n* Ease of calculation\n\n* Reduced dependence on past data\n\n* Easy adjustment of parameters initially derived from past data\n\n***Disadvantages***\n\n* More difficult to explain than empirical\n\n* Parameters relies on past data\n\n* Difficult to ensure parameters are consistent\n\n* Assumes parameter remain constant\n\n* Risk of adopting an inappropriate distribution\n\n* Difficult to reflect complex inter dependencies\n\n    * Use a correlation matrix rather than copula\n\n#### Stochastic Approach\n\nSame way to determine $VaR$ as empirical but the data set used is not the past observed loss\n\n***Data set***:\n\n* **Simulated** using a chosen distribution\n\n    * e.g. multivariate normal\n\n* **Bootstrapped**: random sampling of past observed returns\n\n***Advantages***\n\nCan accommodate:\n\n* More complex features of the underlying loss dist^n^ (e.g. skew, leptokurtosis)\n\n* Wider ranges of future possibilities than the empirical method\n\n* Sensitivity testing (e.g. choice of dist^n^ and parameter values)\n\n***Disadvantages***\n\n* More difficult to explain than the other 2 approaches\n\n* Subjective and difficult choices of distribution and parameters\n\n* Gives a different answer each time (only slightly different ideally)\n\n* Potentially high computation time\n\n***\n\n***Variants of $VaR$***:\n\n* $VaR$ in terms of relative loss (e.g. relative to the expected loss)\n\n* $VaR$ in terms of percentage\n\n* $VaR$ in terms of returns rather than losses (e.g. based on log asset values)\n\n* Different choices of time horizon\n\n* Different choices of confidence level\n\n### Probability of Ruin\n\nProbability that the **net financial position falls below zero** over a defined time horizon\n\n* Closely linked to $VaR$\n\n* e.g. if net financial position is < $VaR_{95\\%}$ then the probability of ruin is > 5% over the same time horizon as the one we used in $VaR$\n\n### Tail Value at Risk (TVaR)\n\nAka **conditional Value at Risk** or **expected shortfall**\n\n$TVaR_{\\alpha} = CVaR_{\\alpha} = \\mathrm{E}\\left[ L \\mid L > VaR_{\\alpha} \\right]$\n\n* **Expected loss** *given* that a **loss over the specified $VaR$** has occurred\n\n***\n\nComparing TVaR of VaR\n\n**Advantages**\n\n* Consider losses beyond VaR\n\n* **Coherent** risk measure\n    \n    * Facilitates the aggregation of TVaR values arising from distinct parts of an org. to determine the overall TVaR\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n* Choice of distribution and parameter is subjective and difficult\n\n* Highly sensitive to assumptions\n\n    * Significant concern as we are using uncertain information from further into the tail of the loss distribution\n\n***\n\nThere are similar variant as VaR as well as other things like tail conditional expectation (TCE) or worst conditional expectation (WCE)\n\n#### Empirical Approach\n\n$TVaR_{\\alpha} =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    \\dfrac{\\sum \\limits_{t = T \\times \\alpha}^T L_{X,t}}{\\sum \\limits_{t = T \\times \\alpha}^T I (t \\geq T \\times \\alpha)} & \\text{if } T \\times \\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\\\\n    \\dfrac{\\left(\\sum \\limits_{t = \\lceil T \\times \\alpha \\rceil}^T L_{X,t} \\right) + [ t_+ - (T \\times \\alpha)]L_{X,t_-}}{\\left(\\sum \\limits_{t = \\lceil T \\times \\alpha \\rceil}^T I (t \\geq T \\times \\alpha)\\right) + (\\lceil T \\times \\alpha \\rceil - T \\times \\alpha)} & \\text{else} \\\\\n  \\end{cases}$\n  \n* $I(t \\geq T \\times \\alpha) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } t \\geq T \\times \\alpha \\\\ 0 & \\text{else} \\\\ \\end{cases}$\n\n#### Parametric Approach\n\n$TVaR_{\\alpha} = \\dfrac{1}{1 - \\alpha} \\int_{\\alpha}^1 VaR_{u} du$\n\ne.g. For Gaussian loss distribution $TVaR_{\\alpha} = \\mu + \\sigma \\dfrac{\\phi\\big(\\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha)\\big)}{1-\\alpha}$\n\n* $\\phi$ is the density function of the standard normal distribution\n\n#### Stochastic Approach\n\nSimilar to the empirical approach but the data is based on simulation or bootstrap\n\n### Expected Shortfall (ES)\n\nCan use empirical, parametric, stochastic approach similar to VaR\n\nSame advantages and disadvantages as TVaR with the additional\n\n**Disadvantage**\n\n* Little intuitive meaning\n* Cannot be readily linked to the current valuation\n\n#### Empirical Approach\n\n$TVaR_{\\alpha} =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    \\dfrac{\\sum \\limits_{t = T \\times \\alpha}^T L_{X,t}}{T} & \\text{if } T \\times \\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\\\\n    \\dfrac{\\left(\\sum \\limits_{t = \\lceil T \\times \\alpha \\rceil}^T L_{X,t} \\right) + [ t_+ - (T \\times \\alpha)]L_{X,t}}{T} & \\text{else} \\\\\n  \\end{cases}$\n  \n* Same as TVaR except the denominator is now $T$ (total # of losses observed not just the tail)\n\n#### Parametric Approach\n\n$ES_{\\alpha} = \\int_{\\alpha}^1 VaR_u du = (1 - \\alpha) TVaR_{\\alpha}$\n\ne.g. For Gaussian $ES_{\\alpha} = (1 - \\alpha) \\mu + \\sigma \\phi \\big( \\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha)\\big)$\n\n#### Stochastic Approach\n\nOnce again similar to empirical approach but with data based on simulation or bootstrap\n\n### Practical Look at VaR and TVaR\n\nVaR is an **industry standard** for measuring and reporting **market risk** in trading portfolio\n\n* Can provide a **consistent** and **comparable** *measure of risk*\n\nVaR draws a **line between** `everyday` and `exceptional losses`\n\nVaR is based on ***3 basic factors*** when quantifying *market risk* in trading portfolios\n\n* **Exposure** amount\n\n    Size of the position at risk\n\n* **Price volatility** factor:\n\n    Best estimate of future daily volatility of market prices\n    \n    * Includes **correlations** between market movements by way of a correlation matrix\n    \n* **Liquidity** factor:\n\n    Time in days to liquidate a position in an orderly fashion and in adverse market conditions, which may be problematic\n\n**Ratio** of `TVaR` and `VaR` can use to indicate the **skewness of a distribution** \n\n* Higher ratio = asymmetric with a fatter tail\n\nSwitching from VaR to TVaR may not be advantageous if the underlying methodology is flawed\n\n* e.g. based on unadjusted historical data which is not appropriate for future application\n\n***Rules of Thumb***\n\n1. Number of days that a mark-to-market loss might exceed $VaR_{\\alpha}$ might be estimated as:\n\n    $[100\\% - \\alpha] \\times 250$\n\n    * Where $\\alpha$ is the confidence level and 250 is the number of trading days in a year\n\n2. Quick approximation of an *n*-day VaR:  \n\n    1-day VaR $\\times$ $\\sqrt{n}$\n\n    * Let $X$ be losses over 1 day $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)$\n    * Then the *n*-day loss $\\sim N(n\\mu, n\\sigma^2)$ and the *n*-day volatility is $\\sqrt{n}\\sigma$  \n\n    Only rough **approximation** as **losses are not iid** and the **expected loss not zero** (esp. for larger *n*)\n\n## Risk Management Time Horizon\n\n***Level of risk increase with time horizon***\n\n* Larger possible outcomes  \n(e.g. insolvency)\n\n* What might happen in the intervening period  \n(e.g. liquidity problems)\n\n***Key factors in choosing time horizon***\n\n* **Time to recover** from a loss event\n\n* **Time to reinstate risk mitigation** (e.g. re-establish a derivatives hedge)\n\n***Financial risk exposure***\n\n* Key issue is the **liquidity of positions impacted** by the decision taken or risk event\n\n* Risk in highly liquid investments can normally be reduced very quickly\n\n***Operational risk exposure***\n\n* Time horizon can be thought of as the **time required for a company to recover** from an event  \n(e.g. fire)\n\n## Risk Discount Rate\n\nFrom ***Risk Analysis and Management for Projects*** (RAMP): a strategic framework for managing project risk and its financial implications\n\n* **Size of the discount rate** will affect the appraised viability of those projects to which it applied\n\n    The higher the discount rate the lower will be the PV of earnings (or benefits) arising in the future and the greater the negative impact on project viability\n\n* Discount rate is determined pragmatically by the sponsor\n\n* Should take account of the sponsor's **cost of capital**, the **rate of inflation**, **interest rates** and **rates of return** on investments throughout the economy\n\n***Challenge of selecting discount rate*** (from Core Reading):\n\n* May no have suitable **reference investments**  \n\n    e.g. no risk free asset that matches certain liabilities\n\n* Difficult to determine the **risk free rate of interest**\n\n    e.g. due to gov securities benefiting form a liquidity premium\n\n* Setting a discount rate that **allows for the uncertainty** of future asset values is problematic\n\n    e.g. projection/simulation approach may be required\n\n* **Allowance for credit risk** (e.g. default) should be made when setting the discount rate and **default rates are linked to other risks** which *vary over time* (e.g. inflation risk)\n\n***Practical discount rate choice*** (Again from RAMP)\n\n* Ultimately the choice of the discount rate will depend partly on issues such as the company's **cost of funds** and **hurdle rates** that the company sets for its investments\n\n* Some companies may wish to use a higher/lower discount rate for projects which they regard as having a **higher/lower inherent risk** than for their other projects\n\n    i.e. risk which is incapable of mitigation\n\n* If this inherent risk varies significantly over different phases of the project, it may sometimes be **appropriate to use different discount rates for each phase**\n\n* **Caveat**: High discount rate should not be seen as a substitute for a detailed risk analysis\n\n    This could lead to the rejection of profitable low risk projects in favor of more profitable projects that carry unacceptable levels of risk\n\n## Recall: CAPM\n\n$\\begin{aligned} r_X &= r_f + \\dfrac{\\sigma_X \\sigma_U \\rho_{X,U}}{\\sigma_U^2}(r_U - r_f)\\\\ &= r_f + \\dfrac{\\sigma_X}{\\sigma_U} \\rho_{X,U}(r_U - r_f)\\\\ &= r_f + \\beta_X(r_U - r_f)\\\\ \\end{aligned}$\n\nWhere:\n\n* $\\beta_X = \\dfrac{\\sigma_X}{\\sigma_U}\\rho_{X,U}$\n\n* $r_X$: expected return on asset $X$\n\n* $r_f$: risk free rate of return\n\n* $r_U$: return on the universe of investment opportunities\n\n***Security Market Line***\n\n* Graph with:\n    \n    X-axis: Systematic risk ($\\beta$)\n    \n    Y-axis: $r_X$\n\n* Security Market Line (SML):\n\n    y-axis intercept = $r_f$\n    \n    Gradient =  $r_U - r_f$\n\n***Project Market Line***\n\n* Project Market Line (PML) is obtained by:\n\n    Re expressing $r_X$ as the required return on project $X$ \n    \n    Re-expressing $U$ as the existing project portfolio\n\n* PML shows that a higher returns is required of a project which, in the context of other project opportunities, exposes and org. to greater uncertainty (higher value of $\\dfrac{\\sigma_X}{\\sigma_U}$) and/or has a lower diversification benefit (higher value of $\\rho_{X,U}$)\n\n* **Caveat** of using the PML to determine the discount rate\n\n    Return on projects and the correlation between them may not be stable over their respective lifetimes\n\n* In practice, it is difficult to find a relationship between the returns from projects anticipated by the PML and those actually achieved\n",
