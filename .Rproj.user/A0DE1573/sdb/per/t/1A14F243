Loss reduction\n2. Uncertainty management\n3. Performance optimization\n\nBusiness typically moves through these 3 stages as their RM capabilities mature\n\nOverall combination of the 3 = ERM\n\n#### Loss Reduction\n\n**First stage** of risk management: **protect against downside losses**\n\n**5 types of controls** aimed at limiting downside losses:\n\n1. **Credit controls**:  \nReduce the probability of default and maximize recovery\n2. **Investment and liquidity policies**:  \nMinimize portfolio losses and ensure liquidity, perhaps by adopting lower-risk investment policies\n3. **Other internal control**:  \nReduce the probability and severity of op-losses\n3. **Audit** process:  \nEnsure the finances of the company are in order\n4. **Insurance coverage**:  \nTransfer risk to 3^rd^ parties\n\n`Loss reduction` is **necessary** but **not sufficient** for ERM\n\n#### Uncertainty Management\n\nRM can help support a business's `profitability` and `business objectives` more positively\n\nSources and degree of volatility have increased greatly in recent decades while business are under pressure from their investors to reduce earnings volatility\n\n**5 improved practices** over loss control that may help to manage the increased volatility\n\n1. **Credit model**:  \nBetter understand credit risk, predict and make provision for losses\n2. **Market risk measurement and management techniques**:  \nSimulation models and measurement tools, including VaR and economic capital\n3. Increased **mangement of op-risk**, particularly `crisis management` and `prevention`\n4. Improved **corporate governance policies**\n5. **Wider application of risk transfer**:  \nUse `derivatives` and `sophisticated insurance products` including `ART`\n\nOverall these developments improve the business's ability to view and understand its risks and return more holistically to the benefit of investors\n\n#### Performance Optimization\n\nFinal stage is to take a more **integrated** approach to risk management and to bring risk management into the **business's decision making** (e.g. product pricing strategic capital investment decisions and budgeting)\n\n1. **Active management** of its `credit risk portfolio`:  \nPricing for risk and disaggregating (breakdown) its credit business into distinct activities\n2. **Active management** of its `balance sheet`:  \nConsidering all assets and liabilities (not just in the investment portfolio) with a view to **optimzing** risk/reward trade off\n3. **Re-engineering** of `processes` to minimize op-risk and to better understand and reduce costs\n\nFor financial companies, such activities are expected by regulators\n\n### Challenges to Implementation\n\n#### Promoting Risk Awareness\n\nSuccessful strategies from improving risk awareness include:\n\n1. Set the **tone form the top**\n    * Critical that the CEO act as a role model by displaying the desired behaviors\n2. **Ask the right questions** concerning risk\n    * Risk/return **balance**\n    * `Limits` and other `controls` to **minimize the downside risk**\n    * **Systems**\n    * **Knowledge**\n3. Establish a common **risk taxonomy**\n    * Common language and risk classification structure ensures consistent measurement and facilitates aggregation when reporting\n4. Provide **induction training** and **ongoing education**\n5. **Link compensation** to `risk` to reward desired behaviors\n\n#### Implementing culture change\n\nCulture can only be changed effectively:\n\n* **From the top** of the organization (i.e. led by the Board and sr management)\n* On an **incremental** basis\n* As the profile of **new recruits** changes the view of the staff\n\n## ERM Maturity Models\n\nMany version of ERM maturity models promoted by consultancies but there is no one right model\n\n* We considered the evolution of RM practice from basic to best practice for market, credit and op-risk\n* External stakeholders (rating agencies, regulators) also have a view on how sophisticated a company's ERM capabilities are\n\n### Lam's 5 Stage ERM Maturity Model\n\n1. **Definition** and **planning**\n\n    Consists of organizing resources to define and scope an ERM program\n      \n    * Identify internal and external requirements for the ERM program\n    * Obtaining Board and management support\n    * Developing overall framework and plan\n    * Appointing key personnel\n    \n2. **Early development**\n\n    Consists of **formalizing** `roles and reponsibilities`, `identifying risks` and `education`\n      \n    * Establishing ERM policies and risk functions\n    * Identifying key risks\n    * Co-ordinating risk and control processes across the functions\n    * Educating and training (esp. for the board)\n    \n3. **Standard practice**\n\n    Consist of improving risk assessment capabilities and developing risk quanitification processes\n      \n    * Establishing risk database for events and losses\n    * Developing KRIs\n    * Establishing risk models for market, credit and op-risk\n    * Measuring risk-adjusted performance\n    \n4. **Business integration**\n\n    Consists of intergrating ERM into business management, operations and remuneration\n      \n    * Evaluating business risk\n    * Quantifying the cost of risk to support pricing and risk transfer decisions\n    * Automating risk reporting\n    * Allocating capital according to risk\n    * Using risk triggers to prompt business decisions\n    * Measuring the effectiveness of ERM processes and linking to executive remuneration\n    \n5. **Business optimization**\n\n    Consist of optimizing business performance, integrating ERM into strategy development and enhancing relationships with key stakeholders\n      \n    * Expanding the scope of ERM to include strategic risk\n    * Integrating ERM into strategic planning processes\n    * Allocating capital and resources to optimize risk-adjusted performance\n    \n### McKinsey 4-Stage Risk Maturity Model\n\nThis model focused more on outputs/benefits than on actions/processes\n\n1. **Initial risk transparency**:  \nCompliance with basic standards, reduction of regular surprises\n2. **Systemic loss reduction**:  \nAbility to avoid large losses, stability to enable growth plan, professionalized management\n3. **Risk-return management**:  \nImproved return on equity, becoming competitive with industry standards\n4. **Risk as competitive advantage**:  \nSenior management focused on risk-adjusted performance\n\n### Deloitte 5-Stage Risk Maturity Model\n\n1. **Unaware/planning**:  \nAd-hoc / chaotic risk management depend primarily on individual capabilities\n2. **Fragmented/specialist silos**:  \nReaction to adverse events by specialists, discrete roles established for small set of risks, basic regulatory compliance\n3. **Top-down**: Tone set at the top  \nPolicies, procedures, risk authorities defined and communicated; measurement is primarily qualitative, reactive risk management\n4. **Systematic**:  \nCo-ordinated risk management across silos, integrated responses to adverse events, rapid escalation and risk culture transformation underway\n5. **Risk intelligent**:  \nRisk management is everyone's job; ERM process is built into decision making using performance-linked metrics\n\n### IAA Stages of ERM Maturity\n\n1. **Early**\n\n    RM and internal control activities **exist in part**\n      \n    * Inconsistently applied and not well understood by management and the relevant employees in **limited** business areas\n    * Significant opportunities for enhancement remain\n    \n2. **Intermediate**\n\n    RM and internal control activities are **established**\n      \n    * Not consistently applied or fully understood by management and relevant employees in **key functions**/business area\n    * Moderate opportunities for enhancement remain\n    \n3. **Advanced**\n    \n    RM and internal control activities are **established**\n    \n    * Consistently applied and well understood by management and relevant employees across the organization\n    * Opportunities for enhancement remain to align and coordinate activity across the organization\n    \nAppendix 2 of IAA note contains a table describing a risk management maturity model\n\n* Has more detail on the above 3 stages broken down by area: role of the Board, RM policy, management accountability, reporting and monitoring\n\n***Key questions to consider** when assessing the maturity of and ERM framework\n\n* **The Board**: Role?\n* **Risk appetite**: How well is it defined, reviewed and communicated?\n* **RM policy**: How comprehensive is it?\n* **Management accountabilities**: How clearly are they defined?\n* **Management commitment and leadership**: How committed is the management to ERM?\n* **RMF**: What responsibilities and resources does it have?\n* **Risk language**: How well developed and documented is it?\n* **Risk management culture**: How well developed is it?\n* **Performance management and reward systems**: How well aligned with ERM are they?\n* **Risk and solvency assessments**: How sophisticated are they?\n* **Risk management processes**: How comprehensive are they?\n* **Reporting and monitoring process and systems**: How comprehensive are they?\n* **Internal audit of compliance with RM policy**: How comprehensive is it?\n* **New activities**: What extent are risk management techniques applied?\n* **Business continuity plans / analysis**: How comprehensive are they?\n\n### Implementation case studies\n\nAppendix 3 of IAA describes some examples of ERM programs in various business\n\n* Successful implementation of an ERM strategy involving building a capital model in a large insurer\n* Cautionary tale of an over-engineered ERM project in a large insurer\n* Apparently successful ERM project in a global insurer, but one where success was measured by the quality of the process, not the quality of the impact on business outcomes",
