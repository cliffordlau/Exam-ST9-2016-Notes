Lau\"\ndate: \"`r format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y')`\"\noutput: \n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    toc_float:\n      collapsed: false\n      smooth_scroll: false\n    toc_depth: 4\n---\n\n## Module Objective\n\nDiscuss the framework for risk management and control within a company\n\n* Discuss how to adopt best practice in ERM in compliance and corporate governance\n\n***\n\nFocus on the process for implementing ERM successfully in an org\n\nThemes in the module is similar to the prior modules, but in the **context of an org's implementation**, over time, of an ERM framework\n\nAdoption of ERM must not be thought of as a one off exercise\n\nIt should be treated as a **dynamic process**, which is regularly reviewed, updated in light of internal changes and changes in the external business environment and improved as best practice regarding thinking in ERM evolves\n\n## Application of ERM to Business\n\n### Implementation Project Management\n\n#### Resourcing\n\nCompany needs to decided on resources for implementing ERM:\n\n* **Internally**:\n\n    Current staff with risk expertise and training further staff\n\n* **Externally**:\n\n    Use risk professional on a consulting basis\n\n* **Both**:\n\n    Calling upon consultants where the org faces gaps in knowledge or needs specialist advice\n\nImplementation of ERM typically takes several years and requires a **risk champion** (i.e. senior exec who is willing to act as project sponsor)\n\n* Sponsor will need to judge that the benefits of an ERM program (e.g. improved efficiency and reduced loss) will outweigh the costs\n\n#### Proportionality and the Pareto Rule\n\n***Proportionality***\n\n* ERM framework appropriate to one org (e.g. small auto insurer) will not be appropriate for a different org (e.g. global composite insurer)\n\n* One size **does not** fit all\n\n***Pareto Rule***\n\n* To ensure ERM adds value, RM activities need to feed through into action\n\n* Decisions on which actions to take are taken based on the data, information and analysis provided to the org decisions makers\n\n* 80% of the effort should be in data collection, analysis and reporting\n\n* 20% to be in the decision making\n\n* BUT **80% of the value** of ERM **is a result of informed decision making**\n\nCompany should ensure that its ERM framework is **commensurate** with the `risks it faces` and the `size/sophistication` of the business; e.g.\n\n* Small retail chain facing simple specific risk will not necessarily  need complex financial models and lots of resources applied to RM\n\n* Large insurer selling a wide variety of products is likely to require sophisticated models, dedicated RM staff and extensive RM processes\n\n#### Top Down / Bottom Up\n\n***Different form*** of ERM implementation\n\n* **Bottom-up**:\n\n    Data is collected and analyzed and fed up to decision makers\n\n* **Top-down**:\n\n    Decision-making structure and policies etc are established and the information gathering and analysis is configured to support it\n\n* Lam suggests that top-down is most efficient and effective\n\n* In practice will be a hybrid of both (e.g. a top down approach that is constrained by existing systems of data recording / analysis)\n\n### Implementation Requirements\n\n***Key questions*** company should ask to ensure a successful ERM implementation\n\n1. **Governance structure** and **politics**:  \n\n    Who is responsible for risk oversight and critical RM decisions?\n\n2. **Risk assessment** and **quantification**:  \n\n    How (ex-ante) will they make these decisions?\n\n3. **Risk management**:  \n\n    What decisions will they make to optimize the risk/return profile of the org\n\n4. **Reporting** and **monitoring**:  \n\n    How (ex-post) will such decisions be monitored?\n\n### Strage of Implementation\n\n3 main ***business applications*** of RM (from Lam):\n\n1. Loss reduction\n\n2. Uncertainty management\n\n3. Performance optimization\n\nBusiness typically moves through these 3 stages as their RM capabilities mature\n\nOverall combination of the 3 = ERM\n\n#### 1. Loss Reduction\n\n**First stage** of risk management: **protect against downside losses**\n\n***5 types of controls*** aimed at limiting downside losses:\n\n1. **Credit controls**:\n\n    Reduce the probability of default and maximize recovery\n\n2. **Investment and liquidity policies**:  \n\n    Minimize portfolio losses and ensure liquidity, perhaps by adopting lower-risk investment policies\n\n3. **Other internal control**:  \n\n    Reduce the probability and severity of op-losses\n\n3. **Audit** process:  \n\n    Ensure the finances of the company are in order\n\n4. **Insurance coverage**:  \n\n    Transfer risk to 3^rd^ parties\n\n`Loss reduction` is **necessary** but **not sufficient** for ERM\n\n#### 2. Uncertainty Management\n\nRM can help support a business's `profitability` and `business objectives` more positively\n\nSources and degree of volatility have increased greatly in recent decades while business are under pressure from their investors to reduce earnings volatility\n\n***5 improved practices*** over loss control that may help to manage the increased volatility\n\n1. **Credit model**:  \n\n    Better understand credit risk, predict and make provision for losses\n\n2. **Market risk measurement** and **management techniques**:  \n\n    Simulation models and measurement tools, including VaR and economic capital\n\n3. Increased **mangement of op-risk**\n\n    Particularly `crisis management` and `prevention`\n\n4. Improved **corporate governance policies**\n\n5. **Wider application of risk transfer**:  \n\n    Use `derivatives` and `sophisticated insurance products` including `ART`\n\nOverall these developments improve the business's ability to view and understand its risks and return more **holistically** to the benefit of investors\n\n#### 3. Performance Optimization\n\nFinal stage is to take a more **integrated** approach to risk management and to bring risk management into the **business's decision making** (e.g. product pricing strategic capital investment decisions and budgeting)\n\n1. **Active management** of its `credit risk portfolio`:  \n\n    Pricing for risk and disaggregating (breakdown) its credit business into distinct activities\n\n2. **Active management** of its `balance sheet`:  \n\n    Considering all assets and liabilities (not just in the investment portfolio) with a view to **optimzing** risk/reward trade off\n\n3. **Re-engineering** of `processes` to minimize op-risk and to better understand and reduce costs\n\nFor financial companies, such activities are expected by regulators\n\n### Challenges to Implementation\n\n#### Promoting Risk Awareness\n\nSuccessful strategies from improving risk awareness include:\n\n1. Set the **tone form the top**\n    \n    * Critical that the CEO act as a role model by displaying the desired behaviors\n\n2. **Ask the right questions** concerning risk\n\n    * **Risk/return balance**\n\n    * `Limits` and other `controls` to **minimize the downside risk**\n\n    * **Systems**\n\n    * **Knowledge**\n\n3. Establish a common **risk taxonomy**\n\n    Common language and risk classification structure ensures consistent measurement and facilitates aggregation when reporting\n\n4. Provide **induction training** and **ongoing education**\n\n5. **Link compensation** to `risk` to reward desired behaviors\n\n#### Implementing culture change\n\nCulture can only be changed effectively:\n\n* **From the top** of the organization (i.e. led by the Board and sr management)\n\n* On an **incremental** basis\n\n* As the profile of **new recruits** changes the view of the staff\n\n## ERM Maturity Models\n\nMany version of ERM maturity models promoted by consultancies but there is no one right model\n\n* We considered the evolution of RM practice from basic to best practice for market, credit and op-risk\n\n* External stakeholders (rating agencies, regulators) also have a view on how sophisticated a company's ERM capabilities are\n\n### Lam's 5 Stage ERM Maturity Model\n\n1. **Definition** and **planning**\n\n    Consists of organizing resources to define and scope an ERM program\n      \n    * Identify `internal` and `external` **requirements** for the ERM program\n    \n    * Obtaining Board and management **support**\n    \n    * Developing **overall framework** and **plan**\n    \n    * Appointing **key personnel**\n    \n2. **Early development**\n\n    Consists of **formalizing** `roles and reponsibilities`, `identifying risks` and `education`\n      \n    * Establishing **ERM policies** and **risk functions**\n    \n    * Identifying **key risks**\n    \n    * **Co-ordinating** `risk` and `control processes` across the functions\n    \n    * **Educating** and **training** (esp. for the board)\n    \n3. **Standard practice**\n\n    Consist of improving risk assessment capabilities and developing risk quanitification processes\n      \n    * Establishing **risk database** for events and losses\n    \n    * Developing **KRIs**\n    \n    * Establishing **risk models** for market, credit and op-risk\n    \n    * **Measuring** risk-adjusted performance\n    \n4. **Business integration**\n\n    Consists of intergrating ERM into business management, operations and remuneration\n      \n    * Evaluating **business risk**\n    \n    * Quantifying the **cost of risk** to support pricing and risk transfer decisions\n    \n    * *Automating* **risk reporting**\n    \n    * **Allocating** capital according to risk\n    \n    * Using **risk triggers** to prompt business decisions\n    \n    * *Measuring* the **effectiveness** of ERM processes and **linking** to executive *remuneration*\n    \n5. **Business optimization**\n\n    Consist of optimizing business performance, integrating ERM into strategy development and enhancing relationships with key stakeholders\n      \n    * Expanding the scope of ERM to include **strategic risk**\n\n    * **Integrating** ERM into strategic planning processes\n\n    *** Allocating capital** and **resources** to optimize risk-adjusted performance\n    \n### McKinsey 4-Stage Risk Maturity Model\n\nThis model focused more on outputs/benefits than on actions/processes\n\n1. **Initial risk transparency**:\n\n    * Compliance with basic standards\n    \n    * Reduction of regular surprises\n\n2. **Systemic loss reduction**:  \n\n    * Ability to avoid large losses\n        \n    * Stability to enable growth plan\n      \n    * Professionalized management\n\n3. **Risk-return management**:  \n\n    * Improved return on equity\n      \n    * Becoming competitive with industry standards\n\n4. **Risk as competitive advantage**:  \n\n    * Senior management focused on risk-adjusted performance\n\n### Deloitte 5-Stage Risk Maturity Model\n\n1. **Unaware/planning**: \n\n    * Ad-hoc / chaotic risk management\n      \n    * Depend primarily on individual capabilities\n\n2. **Fragmented/specialist silos**:  \n\n    * Reaction to adverse events by specialists\n      \n    * Discrete roles established for small set of risks\n      \n    * Basic regulatory compliance\n\n3. **Top-down**: Tone set at the top  \n\n    * Policies, procedures, risk authorities defined and communicated\n      \n    * Measurement is primarily qualitative, reactive risk management\n\n4. **Systematic**:  \n\n    * Co-ordinated risk management across silos\n      \n    * Integrated responses to adverse events, rapid escalation\n      \n    * Risk culture transformation underway\n\n5. **Risk intelligent**:  \n\n    * Risk management is everyone's job\n      \n    * ERM process is built into decision making using performance-linked metrics\n\n### IAA Stages of ERM Maturity\n\n1. **Early**\n\n    RM and internal control activities **exist in part**\n      \n    * Inconsistently applied\n      \n    * Not well understood by management and the relevant employees in **limited** business areas\n      \n    * Significant opportunities for enhancement remain\n    \n2. **Intermediate**\n\n    RM and internal control activities are **established**\n      \n    * Not consistently applied\n      \n    * Not fully understood by management and relevant employees in **key functions**/business area\n      \n    * Moderate opportunities for enhancement remain\n    \n3. **Advanced**\n\n    RM and internal control activities are **established**\n      \n    * Consistently applied\n      \n    * Well understood by management and relevant employees across the organization\n      \n    * Opportunities for enhancement remain to align and coordinate activity across the organization\n    \nAppendix 2 of IAA note contains a table[^IAA-app2] describing a risk management maturity model\n\n* Has more detail on the above 3 stages broken down by area: `role of the Board`, `RM policy`, `management accountability`, `reporting` and `monitoring`\n\n[^IAA-app2]: ***Stages of Enterprise Risk Management Maturity***\n\n

![](figures/figure-31.06.png)\n    ![](figures/figure-31.07.png)\n\n***Key questions to consider*** when assessing the maturity of and ERM framework\n\n* **The Board**:\n\n    Role?\n\n* **Risk appetite**:\n\n    How well is it defined, reviewed and communicated?\n\n* **RM policy**:\n\n    How comprehensive is it?\n\n* **Management accountabilities**:\n\n    How clearly are they defined?\n\n* **Management commitment and leadership**:\n\n    How committed is the management to ERM?\n\n* **RMF**:\n\n    What responsibilities and resources does it have?\n\n* **Risk language**:\n\n    How well developed and documented is it?\n\n* **Risk management culture**:\n\n    How well developed is it?\n\n* **Performance management and reward systems**:\n\n    How well aligned with ERM are they?\n\n* **Risk and solvency assessments**:\n\n    How sophisticated are they?\n\n* **Risk management processes**:\n\n    How comprehensive are they?\n\n* **Reporting and monitoring process and systems**:\n\n    How comprehensive are they?\n\n* **Internal audit of compliance with RM policy**:\n\n    How comprehensive is it?\n\n* **New activities**:\n\n    What extent are risk management techniques applied?\n\n* **Business continuity plans / analysis**:\n\n    How comprehensive are they?\n\n### Implementation case studies\n\nAppendix 3 of IAA describes some examples of ERM programs in various business\n\n* Successful implementation of an ERM strategy involving building a capital model in a large insurer\n\n* Cautionary tale of an over-engineered ERM project in a large insurer\n\n* Apparently successful ERM project in a global insurer, but one where success was measured by the quality of the process, not the quality of the impact on business
