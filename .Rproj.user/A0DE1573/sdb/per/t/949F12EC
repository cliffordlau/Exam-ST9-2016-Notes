Relevant **industry experience and knowledge**\n\n4. **Leadership**:  \n\n    To **develop the ERM vision**\n      \n    Recruit/retain a risk management team\n\n5. **Communication** skills:\n\n    Influence and persuade the business about ERM\n\n6. **Stewardship**:\n\n    Ability to act as a guardian of the org.'s assets\n\n7. **Technical competence**:\n\n    To manage financial and operational risks\n\n8. **Consulting skills**:\n\n    To influence and educate the Board and implement policy\n\nAddition criteria for a risk management expert from Lam (not on syllabus) [^AddCrit]\n\n[^AddCrit]: Addition criteria for a risk management expert from Lam\n\n    * Understanding risk management and governance:\n    \n        Setting risk appetite, risk policies and reporting\n\n    * Knowledge of relevant regulation and legislation\n    \n    * Experience of identifying, assessing and managing risk\n    \n    * Knowledge of ERM and business inter-dependencies\n\n    * Ability to lead, advise the Board and challenge management on risk strategies\n\n### Initial Priorities\n\n**Bring together** *existing* disparate risk related teams or functions to **operate under a common framework**\n\n***Initial priorities***\n\n* Establish clear **understanding** of the company's **risk tolerance**\n\n* **Align management's compensation** with *prudent risk management*\n\n* Have **risk reporting channels**\n\n    So that risks are assessed and information about them is shared in a timely manner\n\n* Assess **gaps** in the `skills`, `capability` and `experience of the team`\n\n* Determine which part of the insurer's business increase its overall **value**\n\n* **Link** risk management to `capital management`, `pricing` and `reserving`\n\n* Provide **quality information** to stakeholders\n\n    Information shouldenables stakeholders to assess the financial condition of the insurer\n\n* Establish **robust governance** structures\n\n* Determine **appropriate** risk management **operating model**\n\n***Requirements of the CRO***\n\n* Establish close working **relationship with the CFO**\n    \n    Both have a role to play to **make earnings more predictable** and less likely to reduce in future\n\n* Have **authority within the organization**  \n(On, or close to the Board)\n\n* **Understand** the insurer's `key stakeholders` and `drivers of performance`\n\n## Risk Management Function\n\nRMF can be a team with distinct functions from different part of the business\n\n### Central Risk Function\n\n***Dedicated CRF*** is key for successful governance models\n\n* *Reports to the Board* through the CRO\n\n* Team of *specialist* risk managers (or just 1 in a small org.)\n\n* CRF **does not manage risk itself**  \n(It's responsibilities of line managers)\n\n***Roles of CRF***:\n\n* **Advice the Board** on risk\n\n* **Assess the overall risk** being run by the business  \n(Accounting for hidden risks and correlations and general uncertainty)\n\n* **Compare** the `overall risk` being run by the business with its `risk appetite`\n\n*  Act as a central focus point for **staff to report new and enhanced risks**\n\n* Give **guidance to line managers** about the `identification` and `management` of risks\n\n* Make **suggestions for risk responses**\n\n* **Monitor** progress on risk management\n\n* Pull the **whole picture** together\n\n### Relationship Between Lines of Defence\n\nRecall from Module 8\n\n* 1st line: line management staff in the BUs\n* 2nd line: CRO, CRF and compliance team\n* 3rd line: Board and IA\n\n#### Relationships between 1st and 2nd\n\n***1. Offence vs defence***\n\n* Setup in **opposition** of each other\n    \n    BU *maximize* **income**\n    \n    RM *minimize* **losses**\n\n* **Disadvantage**:\n  \n    * **Destructive** relationship\n    \n    * **Damaging** to the org. as BU and RM have opposing objectives and incentives\n\n***2. Policy and policing***\n\n* BU **operate within rules** set by RM function\n\n    Policed by the `RM`, `audit` and `compliance functions`\n\n* **Disadvantage**:\n  \n    * **Policies can become outdated** \n    \n        As the RM function is **not in touch** with *day-to-day operation*\n    \n    * Audit and compliance review do no occur continuously so may fail to identify problems\n  \n    * Friction between line management and RM as each **fails to understand the others POV**\n  \n    * Line management may have **little incentive to report problems**, policy violations and issues where it is uncertain whether a violation has occurred\n        \n        Issue is mitigated somewhat by arguments of \"greater good\" or if incentives are linked to policy compliance and reporting violations\n\n***3. Partnership***\n\n* **RM staff are integrated into the BU**\n\n    2 functions share some measures of performance\n\n* BU and RM staff work together in a **client-consultant type relationship** to manage risk\n\n    * BU must recognize the benefit to long term performance of a RM function\n\n    * RM staff must recognize the importance of their role as consultants (i.e. meeting the needs of the BU)\n\n* **Disadvantage**:\n\n    * **Independence may suffer**\n\n    * **Difficult** for RM staff who are integrated into the BUs to have a **corporate oversight role**\n\n***\n\n***Appropriate governance structure depends on***:\n\n* **Structure** of **existing** `committees` and `decision making bodies`\n\n* **Size** and **nature** of the business\n\n* **Risk faced** by the business\n\n* **Autonomy** and **accountability** of the elements in the current corporate structure\n\n    e.g. if individual BU are run autonomously, the RM function needs to support each individual BU, rather than only operating at the \"whole organization\" level\n    \n***Mix organizational structures***\n\n* Large business' RM function may need to **split** between `central team` and `units embedded` in each BU\n\n* Important to ensure there is **no \"silo\" mentality**\n\n    * **Matrix reporting framework**: \n    Each member reports to a number of people across the business\n    \n        Can help avoid the silo mentality\n    \nRisk management committees should include both BU and RM staff\n\n### Challenges in Relationship Management\n\n4 **key challenges** in managing the relationship between BU and RM staff\n\n1. Conflict and **conflict resolution**\n  \n    Conflict arise from **different perspective of risk**  \n    (Opportunity for profit or loss?)\n  \n    * `BU` will want to *increase volumes* and pricing based on **marginal cost**;\n    \n    * `Finance` will want to *grow revenue* and *control risk* and argue for **full cost pricing**\n\n2. Management of **RM staff within BUs**\n  \n    * RM staff embedded may **not be trusted** by BU staff  \n    (stuck between 2 opposing sides) \n  \n    * Best if the **RM staff report to the BU head** and have a **dotted line to CRO**\n  \n    * CRO should have input into the performance review of the risk management staff embedded in BU\n\n3. Aligning **incentives**\n  \n    * Can reduce conflict\n  \n    * In practice it is difficult to design a suitable performance measurement and incentive systems\n\n4. **Measuring operational risks**\n  \n    * Op risk can be **difficult to assess** and take into account in performance measurement systems\n  \n    * Important to ensure a **common taxonomy** around op-risk to help minimize the risk of confusion\n\n### Skill Required within Risk Function\n\n***5 key skills***\n\n1. Project management\n\n2. Change management\n\n3. Relationship management\n\n4. Technical expertise\n\n5. Implementation\n\n## Line Management\n\n***Sustainable*** **ERM framework** *requires support by*:\n\n* **Process for engaging** with BUs\n\n* **Common risk taxonomy**\n\n* **Standard risk management processes**\n\n* **Appropriate incentives** for employees (linked to agreed behaviors)\n\n* Clear **monitoring** and risk **reporting**\n\nRisk management should be incorporated into line management processes (incl. business strategy, new product dev., product pricing, business performance measurement and remuneration)\n\n### Business Strategy\n\nRM should be considered when developing the plans and strategy for each BU (i.e. **ask risk-foucsed questions**)\n\n* What risk may **prevent** us from achieving our objectives?\n\n* How to **assess and monitor** these risk?\n\n* How to **mitigate or transfer** these risk?\n\n* What level of **risk adjusted performance** to expect?\n\n* What **risk limits/tolerances** should be adopted?\n\n* Who will **measure and monitor** the risks involved?\n\n***Benefits of addressing the questions above***:\n\n* BU will **focus on their key risks** and way to mitigate them\n\n* Management receives **advance warning** of *changes in the risks* to which the company is exposed\n\n* Encourage `RM` and `line management` staff to **work together** at **early stage** in a project to address risk and business issues\n\n* **Promote effective risk management** by **linking** `high level business objectives` and `risk appetite` to `risk reporting`  \n(e.g. KRIs linked to KPIs)\n\n### New Product/Business Development\n\nProduct development decisions rely on many assumptions about the business (e.g. likely sales, cost, etc)\n\n***Manage risk of unrealized assumptions***\n\n* Set **trigger points** for each assumption that will trigger a specific action or plan when breached\n\n* Set **specific risk committee** for new product and business development, particularly when expanding into new/foreign markets\n\n### Product Pricing\n\nPricing should **account for all cost of risk**\n\n1. Expected losses\n\n2. Cost of capital\n\n3. Cost of risk transfer\n\nInaccurate pricing can lead to (adverse) selection\n\n### Measuring Business Performance\n\nBU's **performance should be risk adjusted** (as with the BU's goals)\n\n***Balanced scorecard***:  \n*Integrates* `business` and `financial reporting` and should also **incorporate risk assessment** along with \n\n* Finance\n\n* Key stakeholders\n\n* Growth\n\n* Learning\n\n* Internal business processes\n\n### Risk Incentive Compensation\n\n**Disclose link** between `executive compensation` and `RM`\n\n* incl. salaries, incentive based comp. and stock options\n\nComp. arrangements should **discourage excessive** or **inappropriate risk taking**\n\n* If practical, **clawback provisions** should be implemented to recoup incentive based comp. if risk taking, with hindsight was deemed excessive\n\n## Compliance\n\nTypically a separate function in financial services\n\nCompliance with relevant laws, rules and regulations is a **responsibility for all companies and their employees**\n\n### Complaince Process\n\nRequires good knowledge of the legislationand other rules that the org. must comply\n\n* e.g. stock exchange reg., accounting standards, etc\n\n* Traded companies need to observe market conduct standards\n\n* Need systems to prevent abuse\n\n* M&A requires additional compliance\n\n***Consequence of failings***\n\n* Loss of reputation\n\n* Entail providing insider information to outside investors\n\n* Provision to the market of false or misleading information\n\n***Non-compliance***\n\n* If not fully compliance, **risk of non-compliance must be identified**\n\n    Plan should be drawn up for achieving compliance within a suitable timescale\n\n* Need to decide whether to **notify regulators** in case of non compliance\n\n* Need to **monitor progress** towards compliance and take corrective action if necessary\n\n* Penalties for non compliance can be severe\n\n    e.g. see example on employee killing someone driving on company business\n\n## Audit\n\n### Internal Audit\n\nIA **review the risk management process** (on top of checking financial transactions and information)\n\n***IA responsibilities***:\n\n* **Monitor compliance** with `laws` and `regulations`\n\n* Check for **system errors**\n\n* Look for **non-observance** of `internal governance codes`\n\n* Examine key spreadsheets to be free of errors\n\n* **Examine procedures** for paying insurance premiums on time, observing insurance conditions, and ensure that there is no risk of an org. being left uncovered when a claim arises\n\n* Review the **effectiveness of risk management decisions** and **investigate risk management failures**\n\n###External Audit\n\nValidation of the RM process by a separate entity\n\n* May be **required by regulator** (Basel II, SII)\n\n* Potentially provides an **additional source of learning**",
