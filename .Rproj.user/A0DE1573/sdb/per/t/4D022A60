Lau\"\ndate: \"`r format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y')`\"\noutput: \n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    toc_float:\n      collapsed: false\n      smooth_scroll: false\n    toc_depth: 4\n---\n\n## Module Objective\n\nUnderstand **model** and **parameter risk**\n\nDiscuss use of models in the overall ERM decision making process\n\n* Describe the **development** and **use of models** for decision making purpose in ERM\n\n* Discuss how the **decision making process** takes account of the org's `risk appetite` and `corporate governance` and **builds on the results** of `stochastic modeling`, `scenario analysis`, `stress testing` and `analysis of model and parameter risk`\n\n***\n\nConsideration of more **general issues relating to modeling**\n\n* Incl. **model** and **parameter risk**\n\n* **How models can and should be used** as part of the overall ERM process\n\n## Modeling Uncertainty\n\nModel is a **mathematical representation** of **real-world processes**\n\n$\\hookrightarrow$ Representation will be **imperfect**\n\n$\\hookrightarrow$ Incorrect of **sub optimal decisions** may be made\n\n### Sources of uncertainty\n\n***Model risk***:\n\nRisk arising from the use of an **inappropriate or inaccurate model** when assessing or managing risks\n\n* [True model of class of model](#model-ass) is rarely known with certainty\n\n***Parameter risk***:\n\nUse of **inappropriate or inaccurate parameters** or **assumptions** within such models\n\n* Use of [simulated parameters](#sim-para) to account for this\n\n***Stochastic uncertainty***:\n\nArises from the **randomness of a finite set of observations**\n\n* As \\# of observation $\\uparrow$, certainty in the model, parameters, and its prediction $\\uparrow$\n\n* Stochastic models acknowledge this by producing a range of results\n\n### Use of simulated parameters {#sim-para}\n\nDue to limited observations, fitted parameters are never certain\n\n* Projections that assume only stochastic volatility around **unchanging parameters** will lead to the range of **projection** being **too narrow**\n\n* To allow for **parameter uncertainty**, use dynamic (simulated) parameters if the parameters can be modeled in some way\n\n    e.g. if least square regression has been used and a covariance matrix for the parameters is available\n    \n    $\\hookrightarrow$ Multivariate normal dist^n^ can be used to simulate the parameters, which themselves are used in stochastic simulations\n\nApproach to determining the CI for the parameters by estimating a **joint distribution for the parameters**\n\n1. fit a model using $T$ data points\n\n2. Simulate $T$ data points using the model\n\n3. Re-fit the model to the simulate data points\n\n4. Record the parameter values\n\n5. Repeat the process a large number of times, starting with the original data set each time\n\nObtaining a joint distribution for the parameters this way means that rather than using a static set of parameters to carry out the simulations, dynamic parameters can be used instead\n\n***Three assumptions*** that can be made in **relation to the choice of model**  \n<a name=\"model-ass\"></a>\n\n1. **True model** or class of model is **known**\n\n2. Model used is a **simplification** of a **known**, more complex reality\n\n3. Model used is an **approximation** to an **unknown**, more complex reality\n\n    Most common in financial modeling\n    \n***Caveat*** with the 3^rd^ assumption as it can lead to the wrong model\n\n1. **Inappropriate** projection of past **trends** due to\n\n    * **Errors** in historical data\n\n    * **Incomplete** data\n\n    * **Heterogeneity** in the data, where the underlying drivers and their dependencies are not known or not projected separately\n\n2. Selection of an **inappropriate underlying distribution** due to\n\n    * **Insufficient** data\n\n    * Not investigating a range of **alternative candidate distributions**\n\n3. The number of parameters being chosen without reference to:\n\n    * Need to **avoid over simplification** and the **risk of implicit assumptions**\n\n    * **Principle of parsimony**:\n    \n        Where there is a choice of fitted models, the optimal selection is the one with the fewest parameters as this should lead to more stable projections\n    \n## The Use of Models\n\n### Model Development\n\n**Application** of statistical models in practical **ERM context**\n\n***Prime objective*** in building model: \n\n1. Enable the actuary or risk manager to give an organization **appropriate advice** so that it can **manage its risks in a sound financial way**\n\n2. Use in **day-to-day running** of the company\n\n3. Provide **checks and controls** to the business\n\n***Use of model points***\n\n* A very large number of individual data points might need to be brought together into a **manageable number** of relatively `homogeneous groups`\n\n* Groupings need to be made in a way that each policy in a group is expected to produce similar results when the model is run (i.e. homogeneous?)\n\n* Then we can have a representative single policy in each group to be run through the model $\\Rightarrow$ the result to be found $\\Rightarrow$ Scale up this result in order to give the result of the total set policies in the group\n\n* **Model point**: The representative single point in a group\n\n    A number of such \"model points\" can then be used to represent the whole of the underlying business\n\n### Requirements for Models\n\nFor ***generic actuarial model***\n\n* Must be **valid** and **sufficiently rigorous** for the purpose to which it will be put and **adequately documented**\n\n* `Model points` chosen must be such as to **reflect adequately the distribution** of the business being modeled\n\n* `Components of the model` must allow for all those **features** of the business being modeled that could **significantly affect the advice** being given\n\n* `Input parameter` should be **appropriate to the business** being modeled\n\n    *Take into account* the **special features** of the `company` and the `economic` and `business environment` in which it is operating\n\n* `Workings of the model` should be **easy to appreciate** and **communicate**\n\n    `Results` should be **displayed clearly**\n\n* `Outputs` should be capable of **independent verification** for **reasonableness**\n\n    Should be **readily communicable** to those to whom advice will be given\n\n* Model should be *capable* of **subsequent development** and **refinement**\n\n* Model **must NOT be**:\n\n    * **Overly complex**\n    \n        So that either the results become difficult to interpret and communicate\n    \n    * **Too long or expensive to run** (unless this is required by the purpose of the model)\n    \n        Avoid the impression that everything an be modeled\n\n***Additional items for ERM***\n\n* Model should be *amenable* to an analysis of the **impact of parameter uncertainty** or **incorrectly specified parameter values**\n\n* Should exhibit **behavior in simulations** that is **consistent with the past**\n\n    However should not exclude plausible future scenarios that might be quite different from historical patterns\n\n* **Shortcomings** of the model should be **clearly stated**\n\n***Summary***: models should...\n\n* Be **appropriate for purpose** (with limitations recognized)\n\n* Be **robust**\n\n    Having been selected from various possible candidate models with a variety of structures\n\n* Be **as simple as possible** whilst meeting their purpose\n\n    Complex models can be difficult to check, maintain, communicate and may imply spurious accuracy and unjustified confidence\n\n* Be **developed over time**\n\n    With regular reviews identifying when parameters and /or structures need to change\n    \n* **Sometimes be avoided**\n\n    When more importance is attached to other activities\n      \n    (e.g. identification and management of hard to quantify operational risks)\n    \nRisk management models should:\n\n* *Reflect* the **dynamics of the organization**...\n\n* both **now** and as expected in the **future**\n\n* Should allow for **wider external factors**\n\n* Implies that modeling scope should be defined to be **comprehensive** across all **important** and **well-defined risks**\n\n* Different models may exits for component risks, but these need to feed into an overall modeling scheme\n\nOverall objective is to achieve a **balanced** (not unduly exaggerated or smooth) modeling outcome\n\n### Use of Models\n\n***Reasons to build models*** for ERM decision making:\n\n* **Pricing** of products or service\n\n* Assess **economic value** of the company\n\n* Estimate possible **volatility** of future profits and **earnings**\n\n* Determine **capital adequacy requirements** (`regulatory` and `internal`)\n\n* Project **future capital or solvency**\n\n* Assess the **effect of risk management** and **mitigation techniques** on both `profits` and `capital requirements`\n\n* Assess the **effect of other strategic decisions** (e.g. changes in investment or new business strategy)\n\n* **Evaluate projects**\n\n### Modeling Process\n\n***Steps*** of **developing** and **applying** a model:\n\n1. Specify the **purpose** of the investigation\n\n2. Collect **data** and group or modify if necessary\n\n3. Choose the **form** of the model, identify **parameters** and **variables**\n\n4. **Estimate** the required `parameters` and any `correlations` between them\n\n5. Check the **goodness of fit**\n\n    (fit different model if poor fit)\n\n6. Ensure that the model is **able to project all required outputs** \n\n    (e.g. cash flow, etc and incl. interactions between them)\n\n7. **Run** the model with the selected estimated variables (or stochastic variables)\n\n8. **Output** in appropriate format\n\n    (e.g. summarized for stochastic models)\n\n9. Assess the **sensitivity** of results to different deterministic variable values\n\n10. **Monitor** the results of the model and its application and make **refinements** as required\n\nIf cash flow projection over a ***long time horizon*** is required\n\n* **More frequently** the `cash flows` are calculated $\\Rightarrow$ **more reliable** the output from the model\n\n    On the other hand: Less frequent $\\Rightarrow$ model can run faster\n\n### Corporate Decision Making\n\nUsing models in the ***corporate decision making*** process involves:\n\n* **Inputs**: `information`, `data`, `assumption`, `parameters`\n\n* **Model calculations**: `cash flows`, `projections`, `simulations`\n\n* **Outputs**: `deterministic`, `ranges/sensitivities`, `stochastic distribution of outcomes` (as appropriate)\n\n* **Review and discussion**\n\n***\n\n***Additional Considerations***\n\n* The *latter stage* of the process needs to reflect the `risk policy`, `appetite` and the `overall use of judgement` (not just outputs)\n\n**Formalized judgement**\n\n* Can have **quantitative statements** of `risk appetite` and `utility functions` built into the modeling rules\n\n* Should NOT be seen as substitute for the intuition of decision makers\n\n***Market consistent analysis approach***\n\n* Some argues that corporate decision makers should worry only about the risk preferences and other investment opportunities of the company's owner\n\n    (i.e. the market consistent analysis approach)\n    \n* Assumes that:\n\n    **Investors can diversified** away company specific risk\n    \n    Risk premium will compensate for systemic risk\n\n* However **in practice** both `external` and `internal perspectives` **are important**\n\n***Economic Value Added Model***\n\n* A possible model output upon which decisions are made\n\n* **Economic Value**:\n\n    PV of all future s/h profits on economic basis\n    \n* **EVA** expressed as \\% of cost of capital:\n\n    Difference between the increase in economic value and the WACC\n    \n    * Positive incremental EVA means go ahead\n    \n    * But **in practice**, should consider **more than one risk metric** that are **distinct and independent** but not overly complex\n\n***Consideration of different options*** might lead to **further clarification** of an organization's `risk appetite`\n\n* e.g. Model might identify a number of alternative strategies each of which **lies on the efficient frontier** and are **within the risk tolerances**\n\n* Selection of the preferred option may require explicit expression of a corporate risk preference\n\n***Qualitative aspects***\n\n* **Just as if not more important** than `quantitative` aspects for ERM based corporate decision making in practice\n\n* **Reliance on quantitative models alone** (esp. on one model and one specific calibration of that model) **can be dangerous**\n\n    Esp. where the **limitations** of the `data`, `parameters` or **model used are not fully understood** or appreciated\n\n* Many companies that failed during the economic downturn has theoretically sound quantitative risk models\n\nMore on use of capital model in corporate decision making in Module 30\n\n",
