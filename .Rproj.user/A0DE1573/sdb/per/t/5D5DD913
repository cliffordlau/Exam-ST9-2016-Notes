Objective\n\nDiscuss the **framework** for `risk management` and `control` within a company\n\n* Describe an appropriate **framework** for an organization's ERM\n\n* Describe **governance issues** including `market conduct`, `audit`, and `legal risk`\n\n* Discuss the **cultural aspects** of `risk assessment` and management including the `problems of bias`\n\nDescribe how to determine a company's risk appetite, risk capacity and risk objectives\n\nDiscuss the application of the RM control cycle, including the relevance of external influences and emerging risks\n\n***\n\nInformation require to meet each accountabilities and responsibilities thus far is obtained by means of monitoring and communication processes within the organization\n\nThis module will consider all the activities associated with the **monitoring** of:\n\n* `Risk exposures`\n\n* `Risk processes`\n\n## Monitoring Requirements\n\n### Data and Resources\n\nOrganization must **gather suitable data** (`internal` and `external`) on which to base its `risk analysis` to *support* the `risk monitoring` and `communication` process\n\n* Quality of the outcome of the RM process is dependent on the quality of data\n\nNeed to **invest** in **appropriate systems and technology** with **adequate HR to support** this process\n\nPeople need to have **clear objectives** and **reporting lines**\n\n### Documentation\n\nRM process should be supported with **thorough documentation** using **common templates** *cross business*\n\nThings that should be properly documented\n\n* RM **decisions made** and **reasons**\n\n* **Systems**  \n(e.g. system spec and user acceptance testing of IT systems)\n\n* **Financial models** (incl. assumptions and data used)\n\n* Risk management **failures** (incl. nature of failure and losses incurred)\n\n### Information\n\nSubstantial amount of information is needed to operate and manage risk effectively\n\nInformation needs to be delivered in a **timely** manner and **reliable**\n\n*Trade off* between the ***amount of data***:\n\n* *Too much* data so that processing it **cannot be usefully digested**\n\n* *Too little* data, so that it is **uninformative**\n\n### Communication\n\n**Communication**:  \nThe way that information is collected and disseminated\n\n***Types of communication***\n\n* **Internal** (management info):\n\n    About what is happening inside the business\n      \n    (e.g. CF position, sales, inventory levels)\n\n* **External** (inwards): \n\n    What is happening outside the company\n      \n    (e.g. competitors' sales)\n\n* **External** (outwards): \n\n    Distributing information about the company to interested parties\n      \n    (e.g. media, s/h, regulators)\n\n* **Informal**: \n\n    Word of mouth (or social media)\n\n* **Formal**: \n\n    Through corporate intranet, management information systems, reports and or corporate newsletters\n\nRM process and results must be **communicated effectively** to `stakeholders` to **enable them to monoitor** the RM strategies and **complete the necessary feedback loops**\n\n* **Internal communications**  \n(e.g. to Board or relevant committees)\n    \n    * So they are fully *appraised* on the **risk being faced** by the org. and how they are being **dealt with**\n\n* **External communications**  \n(e.g. supervisory bodies, investors, analysts)\n  \n    * Need to clearly *articulate* its risk management strategies to these key stakeholders to **receive the full benefit of its investment in ERM**\n  \n    * Need to be aware of sharing sensitive information\n\n***Benefits of consistent risk language (taxonomy)***\n\n* Helps avoid problems such as **duplication** or **omission of risk**\n\n* **Increase the speed** with which ERM becomes **embedded** in an organization\n\n    Particularly important for multi-national companies, where the use of different terminology in different domains can confound the ERM process\n\n## Risk Metrics\n\nRisk metrics are *included* in **regular risk reporting**\n\n* Important part of the **feedback loop** so the Board can **monitor the amount of risk** being taken and gauge the **effectivenss of the risk policies**\n\n***Purpose of risk metrics***\n\n1. **Support** the *implementation* of the **risk appetite framework**  \n(Usually using multiple risk metrics at the same times)\n\n2. **Measure** whether the company is *operating within* its **risk tolerance limits**\n\n3. **Easier to use** in real business decisions\n\n    `Risk appetite` and `risk tolerance statements` are typically probabilistic statements relating to financial and non financial events  \n    \n    $\\therefore$ difficult and time consuming to measure\n\n***Risk Metrics***\n\n* Consist of **quantitative** and **qualitative** indicators of the **level of risk** in a *specific part* of the organization\n\n* Each level of risk appetite statement may utilize a **number of risk metrics** (see Module 14 for more)\n\n* Risk metrics can be found at a **supporting level below** the detail included in the `risk tolerance` and `limit statements`\n\n    e.g. IT systems downtime and staff turnover rates can be used as indicator of the level of op-risk to which the org. is exposed to\n\n* Quantitative or qualitative thresholds in these metrics may **act as triggers** to *identify* potential problem areas so that actions can be taken\n\n### Risk Metrics Examples\n\nBoard set limit on the level of market risk\n\nRM function then implement this limit by conducting analysis to identify the **key drivers** of market risk that might lead to a breach of this limit (e.g. equity and interest rate risk)\n\nRM function than decide to monitor **simple indicators** such as the `% of equity in the portfolio` and the `level of duration mismatch` between asset and liabilities for a **quick and early indication** of changes in the risk profile that may lead to a breach of risk tolerance\n\nThese indicators are the risk metrics\n\n## Key Risk Indicators\n\n***Key Risk Indicators***:  \nRisk metrics that form a **key part** of an organization's risk management framework\n\n* Range of quantitative and qualitative **risk metrics** that are developed to ensure the org. have a **board view of their risk exposures**\n\n* The design, implement, monitor and report of KRI is part of the EMR control cycle (from Module 8)\n\n***Using KRIs***\n\n* Managers can use KRIs to *identify* when `risk limits` are **close to being exceeded**\n\n* Prompt actions designed to keep the organization within its risk tolerances\n\n***Factors to consider on what KRIs to use***:\n\n* **Policies** and **regulations**  \n(e.g. regulatory limits)\n\n* **Strategies** and **objectives**  \n(e.g. volatility of results)\n\n* **Past losses** and incidents (to help judge what is *significant*)\n\n* **Stakeholder** requirements  \n(e.g. variables monitored by `credit rating agencies`)\n\n* **Risk assessments** (some areas maybe require closer scrutiny than others)\n\n***Desirable features of KRI***:\n\n* **Quantifiable** (i.e. %, $, numbers)\n\n* Based on **consistent** `methodologies` and `standards`\n\n* *Incorporate* **key risk drivers**  \n(e.g. `exposure`, `probability`, `severity` and `correlation`)\n\n* **Tracked over time**\n\n* **Tied to objectives**\n\n* *Linked to* an **accountable individual**\n\n* *Useful* in **decision making**\n\n* *Able to be* **bench-marked externally**\n\n* **Timely**\n\n* **Cost effective** to measure\n\n* **Simple** (not simplistic)\n\n* **Balance** of `leading` and `lagging` indicators\n\n## Risk Reporting\n\n### Feedback Loops\n\n***Feedback loop***:  \nProcess by which `management` and other `stakeholders` are **informed** of any significant **issues** or **changes** in the `business` and/or the `environment`\n\n* Information about changes may come from **sources** that provide information about `past events`, the `presents` or `expectations for the future`\n\n* Incorporating feedback loops is one way in which an org. can **ensure** that its ERM framework is able to **identify** and **respond appropriately** to such changes\n\n### Reporting Processes\n\n***Importance of effective reporting***\n\n* Ensure stakeholder have the risk **information required**\n\n* Ensure RM framework is **embedded** within an org.\n\n* Reflect risk in management decisions\n\n* **Effective monitoring** of risk levels\n\n* Board and senior management need info and feedback to *assess* **effectiveness of the RM policies** and *identify* **areas for improvement**\n\n***Risk reporting should answer 5 key questions***\n\n1. Are our **business objectives** at risk?\n\n2. Are we in **compliance** with `policies`, `laws` and `regulations`?\n\n3. What risk **incidents** have been escalated and require attention?\n\n4. What **KPIs** or **KRIs** need attention?\n\n5. What **risk assessments** need to be reviewed?\n\n***Good Risk reporting***\n\n* **Clear** and **relevant**\n\n* Closely **linked** to the management of the org.'s `risk appetite` and `risk tolerances`\n\n* **Link** clearly to **decisions** that the org. needs to make\n\n* **Include KRIs** to provide sufficient information to allow clear and timely decision making\n\n* **Balance** between the need to include all `relevant information` vs need for `clarity and simplicity`\n\n    Important that it includes information at the appropriate level of detail for the intended audience\n\n#### Risk Report Components\n\n***Key components of risk report*** to a `Board`\n\n* **Qualitative** and **quantitative** information\n\n* **Summary** of `losses` and `incidents`\n\n* **Summary** of `business risks` and the **key discussions and decisions required** from the Board\n\n* Narrative from management on **important data and trends**\n\n* **KPIs against KRIs** with important deviations and trends highlighted\n\n* **Important events / milestones**  \n(e.g. regulatory visit)\n\nRisk reports to business managers can be more detailed with an emphasis on quantitative rather than qualitative analysis (Module 14)\n\n#### Risk Report Structure\n\n***Risk report structure***:\n\n* **Split** according to `risk types` and `operating units`\n\n* Include **summaries** of `key risk areas`  \n      \n    (In tabular or graphical form)\n\n* Indication of **likelihood** and **severity** of impact of each *key risk areas*\n\n* **Traffic light systems** (RAG) are common way in which to highlight areas of focus\n\n* **Monitoring** and **evaluation** of **risk management actions**\n\n    Incl. clear statement of accountabilities\n     \n    Effectiveness of RM actions should be considered against the status of each risk area  \n    \n* Report on **new, emerging risks** and **trends over time**\n\nNeed to present sufficient data to ensure decision makers are well informed yet not so much data that they can't see the wood for the trees\n\n* Data is typically abundant in a large org. but the difficulties is in how to best summarize and present the data to sr mgmt\n\n#### Management Reporting System Design\n\n***Top down approach***\n\n* Best way to do it\n\n* For a given audience, think about what information they need to make the decisions they are responsible for\n\n* Once identified, the information needs to be presented in a way that is easily understood\n\n***Good reporting system***:\n\n* `Forward looking`, `dynamic`, `decisions-driven`, `online`\n\n* Example:\n\n    * **Single point of access** to `critical risk information` collated from various risk systems and data sources\n\n    * **Role-based summary** of risk to key decision makers with **drill-down capabilities** to more detailed information\n\n    * Prioritized **just-in-time information**  \n(e.g. from real-time alerts to quarterly summaries)\n\n    * **Mixture** of `qualitative` vs `quantitative`, `internal` vs `external data`\n\n    * Opportunity for **users** to provide `commentary`, `explanation` or `analysis` of the information\n\n***Bad reporting system***:\n\n* `Historically focused`, `silo-based`, `data driven`, `manually prepared`, `paper based`, `static`\n\n* Example:\n\n    * **Simply collating data** from silos\n    \n    * **Overwhelming users** with too much information\n    \n    * Providing **too much qualitative data** that does not aid decision making\n    \n    * Focusing on **quantity rather than quality** of information\n\nSee example of [2001 GE Business cockpit](http://www.ge.com/annual01/letter/cockpit/)\n\n#### Balanced Scorecard / Dashboard Reporting\n\n***Balanced scorecard***\n\n* Commond reporting approach\n\n* **Integrates** `business` and `financial` reporting\n\n* Risk assessment in the form of **KRIs is usually incorporated** (on top of KPIs)\n\n* Similar to Lam's dashboard reporting\n\n***Common area of assessment for balanced scorecard***\n\n1. Finance\n\n2. Stakeholders (e.g. customers or clients)\n\n3. Growth and learning\n\n4. Internal business processes\n\n***Balance scorecard for effectiveness of the ERM function***\n\n* Is the **cost of risk** minimized?  \n(e.g. losses and mitigation/ management cost)\n\n* No surprises on **regulatory/ policy violations**?\n\n* **Performance based** feedback loops  \n(e.g. risk assessments (ex-ante) vs actual losses / events (ex-post))\n\n* ERM **development milestones** met?",
