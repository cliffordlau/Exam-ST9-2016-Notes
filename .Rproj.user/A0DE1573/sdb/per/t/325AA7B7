Simulate $T$ data points using the model\n3. Re-fit the model to the simulate data points\n4. Record the parameter values\n5. Repeat the process a large number of times, starting with the original data set each time\n\nObtaining a joint distribution for the parameters this way means that rather than using a static set of parameters to carry out the simulations, dynamic parameters can be used instead\n\n**Three assumptions** that can be made in relation to the choice of model\n\n1. True model or class of model is known\n2. Model used is a simplification of a known, more complex reality\n3. Model used is an approximation to an unknown, more complex reality\n    * Most common in financial modeling\n    \n**Caveat** with the 3^rd^ assumption as it can lead to the wrong model\n\n* Inappropriate projection of past trends due to\n    * Errors in historical data\n    * Incomplete data\n    * Heterogeneity in the data, where the underlying drivers and their dependencies are not known or not projected separately\n* Selection of an inappropriate underlying distribution due to\n    * Insufficient data\n    * Not investigating a range of alternative candidate distributions\n* The number of parameters being chosen without reference to\n    * Need to avoid over simplification and the risk of implicit assumptions\n    * Principle of parsimony: where there is a choice of fitted models, the optimal selection is the one with the fewest parameters as this should lead to more stable projections\n    \n## The Use of Models\n\n### Model Development\n\nApplication of statistical models in practical ERM context\n\nPrime objective in building model: \n\n* Enable the actuary or risk manager to give an organization appropriate advice so that it can manage is risks in a sound financial way\n* Use in day-to-day running of the company\n* Provide checks and controls to the business\n\n***\n\nA very large number of individual data points might need to be brought together into a manageable number of relatively homogeneous groups\n\nGroupings need to be made in a way that each policy in a group is expected to produce similar results when the model is run\n\nIt is then sufficient for a representative single policy in each group to be run through the model, the result to be found, and for this result to be scaled up in order to give the result of the total set policies in the group\n\nThe representative single point in a group is termed a \"**model point**\" and a number of such \"model points\" can then be used to represent the whole of the underlying business\n\n### Requirements for Models\n\nFor generic actuarial model\n\n* Must be valid and sufficiently rigorous for the purpose to which it will be put and adequately documented\n* Model points chosen must be such as to reflect adequately the distribution of the business being modeled\n* Components of the model must allow for all those features of the business being modeled that could significantly affect the advice being given\n* Input parameter should be appropriate to the business being modeled; and take into account the special features of the company and the economic and business environment in which it is operating\n* Workings of the model should be easy to appreciate and communicate; results should be displayed clearly\n* Outputs should be capable of independent verification for reasonableness and should be readily communicable to those to whom advice will be given\n* Model should be capable of subsequent development and refinement\n* Model much not be overly complex so that either the results become difficult to interpret and communicate or the model becomes too long or expensive to run (unless this is required by the purpose of the model); avoid the impression that everything an be modeled\n\nAdditional items for ERM\n\n* Model should be amenable to an analysis of the impact of parameter uncertainty or incorrectly specified parameter values\n* Should exhibit behavior in simulations that is consistent with the past; however should not exclude plausible future scenarios that might be quite different from historical patterns\n* Shortcomings of the model should be clearly stated\n\nSummary: models should...\n\n* Be appropriate for purpose (with limitations recognized)\n\n* Be robust\n\n    Having been selected from various possible candidate models with a variety of structures\n\n* Be as simple as possible whilst meeting their purpose\n\n    Complex models can be difficult to check, maintain, communicate and may imply spurious accuracy and unjustified confidence\n\n* Be developed over time\n\n    With regular reviews identifying when parameters and /or structures need to change\n    \n* Sometimes be avoided\n\n    When more importance is attached to other activities (e.g. identification and management of hard to quantify operational risks)\n    \nRisk management models should reflect the dynamics of the organization both now and as expected in the future and should allow for wider external factors\n\n* This implies that modeling scope should be defined to be comprehensive across all important and well-defined risks\n* Different models may exits for component risks, but these need to feed into an overall modeling scheme\n\nOverall objective is to achieve a balanced (not unduly exaggerated or smooth) modeling outcome\n\n### Use of Models\n\nReasons to build models for ERM decision making\n\n* **Pricing** of products or service\n* Assess **economic value** of the company\n* Estimate possible **volatility** of future profits and **earnings**\n* Determine **capital adequacy requirements** (regulatory and internal)\n* Project **future capital or solvency**\n* Assess the **effect of risk management** and mitigation techniques on both profits and capital requirements\n* Assess the **effect of other strategic decisions** (e.g. changes in investment or new business strategy)\n* **Evaluate projects**\n\n### Modeling Process\n\nSteps of developing and applying a model:\n\n* Specify the **purpose** of the investigation\n* Collect **data** and group or modify if necessary\n* Choose the **form** of the model, identify **parameters** and **variables**\n* **Estimate** the required `parameters` and any `correlations` between them\n* Check the **goodness of fit** (fit different model if poor fit)\n* Ensure that the model is **able to project all required outputs** (e.g. cash flow, etc and incl. interactions between them)\n* Run the model with the selected estimated variables (or stochastic variables)\n* Output in appropriate format (e.g. summarized for stochastic models)\n* Assess the sensitivity of results to different deterministic variable values\n\nIf cash flow projection over a long time horizon is required\n\n* More frequently the cash flows are calculated $\\Rightarrow$ more reliable the output from the model\n* Less frequent $\\Rightarrow$ model can run faster\n\n### Corporate Decision Making\n\nUsing models in the corporate decision making process involves:\n\n* **Inputs**: information, data, assumption, parameters\n* **Model calculations**: cash flows, projections, simulations\n* **Outputs**: deterministic, ranges/sensitivities, stochastic distribution of outcomes (as appropriate)\n* **Review and discussion**\n\nThe latter stage of the process needs to reflect the risk policy, appetite and the overall use of judgement (not just outputs)\n\nCan have quantitative statements of risk appetite and utility functions built into the modeling rules (formalized judgement) BUT should be seen as substitute for the intuition of decision makers\n\nSome argues that corporate decision makers should worry only about the risk preferences and other investment opportunities of the company's owner\n\n* $\\Rightarrow$ market consistent analysis\n* Assumes that investors can diversified away company specific risk and risk premium will compensate for systemic risk\n\nHowever in practice both external and internal perspectives are important\n\nEVA is a possible model output upon which decisions are made based on\n\n* PV of all future s/h profits on economic basis\n* Can be expressed as \\% of cost of capital\n* Positive incremental EVA means go ahead\n* But in practice, should look at more than one risk metric that are **distinct and independent** but not overly complex\n\nAlso keep in mind that the consideration of different options might lead to further clarification of an organization's risk appetite\n\n* Model might identify a number of alternative strategies each of which lies on the efficient frontier\n* And within the risk tolerances\n* Selection of the preferred option may require explicit expression of a corporate risk preference\n\nQualitative aspects are just as important than quantitative aspects for ERM based corporate decision making in practice\n\nReliance on quantitative models alone (esp. on one model and one specific calibration of that model) can be dangerous particularly where the limitations of the data, parameters or model used are not fully understood or appreciated\n\n* Many companies that failed during the economic downturn has theoretically sound quantitative risk models\n\nMore on use of capital model in corporate decision making in Mod 30\n\n",
