Introduction of **new regulatory capital requirements**\n\n3. **Increased emphasis on sophisticated quantitative models** for other types of risks\n\n4. There is **no inherent upside to op-risk**\n\n5. **High profile problems** at other companies caused by op-risk failures\n\nReasons why a more ***formal approach is advantageous***:\n\n6. Op-risk has been the **main driver** behind many cases of major **financial disaster**\n\n7. Op-risk is **inter-linked** with `credit` and `market risk`\n\n    Important to **minimize the likelihood of op-risk failure** during already **stressed market** conditions\n\n8. Op-risk may **otherwise be treated differently** in different areas of the company\n\n    Can lead to key risks being over looked and decisions being taken based on inaccurate information or an incorrect assessment of a BU's risk-adjusted return\n\n***Benefit*** of `consistent` and `effective` op-risk management (that is distinct from the general benefits arising from management of other types of risks)\n\n* **Minimize impact of reputational damage** from incident linked to op-loss\n\n    These incidents are more likely to give the company the appearance of being badly managed and ill-equipped to deal with errors than other risk events\n\n* **Minimizes** `day-to-day losses` and **reduces the potential** for more `extreme and costly incidents`\n\n* Improves ability to `meet business objectives`\n\n    (less time spend on crisis management)\n\n* **Strengthens** `overall ERM process and framework`\n\nOp-risk management is still very much a **developing area** but is widely accepted that all companies should be considering this issue\n\nA **comprehensive approach** should be adopted\n\n* Focus should primarily be on the **management of op-risk** (later module)\n\n    Rather than attempt to (spuriously) precisely measure the risk present\n\n## Assessing Operational Risk\n\nOrganizations have only recently started gathering operational loss data\n\nBased on initial analysis of publicly available data:\n\n* Distribution is **skewed** to the right\n\n* Severities have a **heavy tailed** distribution\n\n* **Losses occur randomly** in time\n\n* Loss **frequency may vary considerably** over time\n\n***2 types of losses to distinguish***\n\n1. Small **day-to-day** mistake made in the course of business\n\n    May be modelled\n      \n    e.g. using statistical distributions or high-claim-frequency non-life reserving techniques\n\n2. **Infrequent, large events**\n\n    (e.g. major frauds or failed projects)\n      \n    Require methods such as extreme value techniques (fitting GPD)\n    \n***Model approach***\n\n1. **Bottom up model**:\n\n    Estimates the operational risk capital by **starting the analysis at a low level of detail** \n      \n    (i.e. looking at each category of op-risk in return)\n        \n    and then aggregating the results\n\n2. **Top down model**:\n\n    Use `readily available data` and `fairly simple calculations` to give a **general picture of the operational risk** of a company\n\n    * Insurance companies are more likely to practice to use a high level scenario analysis technique from a top down perspective\n\n### Bottom-up Models\n\nEstimates the operational risk capital by **starting the analysis at a low level of detail** (i.e. looking at each category of op-risk in return) and then aggregating the results\n\n#### 1. Statistical Analysis\n\nNeed model that **cope well** with the **outer tail** of the loss distribution\n\n**EVT** (Module 20) may be suitable for assessing infrequent, potentially catastrophic risks\n\n* Reasonable to assume the inflation adjusted loss amount at least have a common severity distribution\n\n* Some suggests the **GPD** as one of the most useful tools to fit loss distribution in the extreme tails\n\n* However EVT may be appropriate but this approach is **not widely use** due to the **lack of internal data**\n\nGiven sufficient data to come up with an estimated loss distribution, then Monte Carlo might be used to estimate op-risk capital for a given CI\n\n#### 2. Scenario Analysis\n\nUseful technique due to the potential **linkage** between `op-risk` and `other risk`\n\n***Steps for applying scenario analysis to op-risk assessment***\n\n1. **Group** risk exposures into *broad* categories\n\n    e.g. risk invovling `financial fraud`; `system errors`, etc\n    \n    * Require input from a wide range of senior individuals in the organization\n    \n2. Develop **plausible adverse scenario** for *each group* of risk\n\n    * Need to be plausible to determine the consequence of the risk event\n    \n    * The scenario is deemed to be representative of all risk in the group\n    \n3. Calculate the **consequence** of the risk event occurring for each scenario\n\n    * Also will involve senior staff input\n    \n    * Financial consequences could include:\n    \n        * Redress paid to those affected\n        \n        * Cost of correcting systems and records\n        \n        * Regulatory fees and fines\n        \n        * Ppportunity costs while any changes are made, etc\n    \n    * In practice the mid-point of a range of possible values is usually taken\n    \n4. **Total costs** calculated are taken as the financial cost of all risks represented by the **chosen scenario**\n\n5. Assessment of likelihood and severity made by a scenario analysis can be **displayed on a risk map**\n\n***Benefits*** of scenario analysis\n\n* **Captures** `opinions`, `concerns` and `experience` of **risk managers**\n\n* **Not rely heavily on** `availability` / `accuracy` / `relevance` of **historical data**\n\n* Provide opportunity to identify hard to predict, high-impact events\n\n* Identify and *improve understanding* of **cause and effect** relationship\n\n* **Reduce risk-reward arbitrage** opportunities\n\n#### Pros and Cons\n\n***Advantage*** of bottom-up model\n\n* Give a more **robust picture** of company's overall risk\n\n***Limitations***\n\n1. **Difficult to break down** reported aggregate losses into their constituent components\n\n2. **Little robust internal historical data**\n\n    Esp. for low probability and high impact events\n\n3. **Application of external data is difficult** due to difference between companies\n\n#### Basel AMA\n\n***Basel advanced measurement approach (AMA)***\n\n* Under the Basel AMA, op-risk is assessed using **internal models** (stat analysis) and **scenario analysis**\n\n    (Subject to approval and continual checking by the supervisory authorities)\n\n* Standard is a 1-year holding period of a 99.9% CI\n\n    Consistent with the Basel standard for credit risk analysis (mod 30)\n\n* Op-risk loss categories:\n\n    * `8 business lines`\n    \n        (e.g. retail banking, agency service, etc)\n    \n    * Further into `7 loss-event types`\n    \n        (e.g. internal fraud, damage to physical assets etc)\n\n* 3 specific **areas that need credible data** (on probability and expected size of potential losses)\n\n    1. Internal data on **repetitive high frequency losses** over a 3-5 years period\n\n    2. External data on **non-repetitive, low frequency losses**\n\n    3. Suitable **stress scenarios** to consider\n\n* Overall, statistical methods are difficult to apply due to the lack of data\n\n    (as banks have only recently started such information gathering)\n\n#### Factor-based models\n\nSimpler approach (due to lack of data) that *assumed* losses are related to the **volume of transactions**\n\n* Apply a **weighting** to the actual or expected **volume of transactions**\n\n    (e.g. Basel indicator and standardized approaches)\n\n***Disadvantage***: Op-risk exposure may no be proportional to business volumes (might not a good proxy)\n\n* Does not account for complexity of risk the org. faces\n\n* International companies faces additional difficulties and potential op-risk\n\n* Some companies have taken great steps to avoid op-risk by documenting procedures, having well trainged staff etc\n\n***Basel indicator approach*** (BIA)\n\n* Operational risk capital ($K_{BIA}$)\n\n    $K_{BIA} = \\dfrac{\\sum \\limits_{t=1}^3 \\alpha \\: max(GI_t,0)}{\\sum \\limits_{t=1}^3 I(GI_t >0)}$\n\n    * $GI_t$: Gross income in the prior year $t$\n\n    * Basel Committee suggest that $\\alpha$ should be 15%\n\n***Basel standardized approach***(SA)\n\n* Similar to BIA except that gross income is split down and attributed to each of **8 business lines** with a **different multiplier** each\n\n    $K_{SA} = \\dfrac{1}{3} \\sum \\limits_{t=1}^3 max \\left(\\sum \\limits_{j=1}^8 \\beta_j GI_{j,t}, 0\\right)$\n\n    * $\\beta_j$ is between 12% and 18% depending on the business\n\n    * $GI_{j,t}$ is the gross income for business line $j$ in the prior year $t$\n\n### Top-down Models\n\nUse `readily available data` and `fairly simple calculations` to give a **general picture of the operational risk** of a company\n\nLook at 4 models, but they all fail to capture successfully low probability high consequence risk events\n\n#### 1. Implied Capital Model\n\n    Operational risk capital = Total risk capital - Non-op-risk capital\n\n***Advantages***: Simple and forward looking\n\n***Limitations***\n\n* **Total risk capital** needs to be estimated (not easy)\n\n* **Inter-relationship** between the different types of risks are **ignored**\n\n* **Does not capture cause and effect** scenarios\n\n    (i.e. where op-risk arises in the company and its specific impact)\n\n#### 2. Income Volatility Model\n\nLooks at **income volatility** as the **primary factor** determining capital allocation\n\n    Operational risk income volatility = Total income-volatility - Non-op-risk income-volatility\n\nRelative ***advantage*** over method 1.\n\n* **Better data availability** in respect of total income volatility than for the total risk capital needed for the previous model\n\n***Limitations***\n\n* **Ignores** the rapid **evolution of companies** and industries (over time the income volatility of companies will change)  \n\n    (i.e. not forward looking)\n\n* Focus on **income rather than value**\n\n    (Does not capture the \"softer\" measures of risk, such as opportunity cost and the value of reputation/brand)\n\n#### 3. Economic Pricing Model\n\n**CAPM**\n\n* Assumes that all market information is included in a company's share price\n\n* Impact of any publicized op-loss can be identified by looking at the movement in a company's share price and stripping out the overall market movement\n\nRelative ***advantage*** over method 2.\n\n* Includes both the **aggregate effect of specific risk events** and the **\"softer\" issues**\n\n    (e.g. opportunity cost and/or damage to reputation/brand)\n\n***Limitations***\n\n* No information is provided on **losses due to specific risks** (only aggregate)\n\n* Level of op-risk capital is **unaffected by any controls** put in place\n\n    (little motivation to improve the risk management process)\n\n* **Tail-end risks** are not accounted for thoroughly\n\n* **Does not help anticipate** incidents of operational risk as there is no consideration of individual risks in isolation\n\n#### 4. Analogue Model\n\nUse **data from similar companies** to derive operational risk capital\n\nUseful if there is little internal data available (but debatable how accurately one company mirrors another in terms of risk profile)\n\n## Operational Risk Assessment Process\n\n***Systematic process*** for managing a company's op-risk\n\n* Risk **policy** and organization (focus of the module)\n\n* Risk **identification** and **assessment** (focus of the module)\n\n* **Capital allocation** and **performance measurement** (cover in later module)\n\n* Risk **mitigation** and **control** (cover in later module)\n\n* Risk **transfer** and **finance** (cover in later module)\n\n#### Risk Policy and Organization\n\nA ***comprehensive*** operational risk management policy should include:\n\n1. **Principles** for operational risk management\n\n2. Definitions and **taxonomy** for op-risk\n\n3. **Objectives** and **goals** of op-risk management\n\n4. Op-risk management **processes** and **tools**\n\n5. **Org structure**, as it applies to operational risk management\n\n6. **Roles** and **responsibilities** of different business areas involved in operational risk management\n\n#### Risk Identification and Assessment\n\nNeed a ***wide range of tools and techniques*** as it covers a broad range of issues\n\n1. ***Loss incident databases***\n\n    * Help a company to **learn** from previous loss incidents\n    \n    * Help analyse **trends**\n    \n    * Support **root causes analysis** of op-losses\n    \n    * Support any **mitigation strategies** applied\n\n2. ***Controls self-assessment***\n\n    Internal analysis of the key risks and their controls and management implications\n\n3. ***Risk mapping***\n\n    * (Discussed in Mod 13) **Ranks** the company's key risk exposures by severity and frequency\n\n    * Helps **prioritize risk**\n    \n        Ensure resources are targeted to the most important risks\n\n4. ***Risk indicators and minimum acceptable performance triggers***\n\n    * Quantitative measures can be set up (e.g. \\# of customer complaints)\n    \n    * Used to **establish goals** and **levels of minimum acceptable performance** (MAP)\n\n    * Action plans should be in place to deal with any non attainment of the MAP",
