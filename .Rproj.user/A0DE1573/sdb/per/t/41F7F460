Objective\n\nDiscuss the framework for risk management and control within a company\n\n* Discuss the **cultural aspects** of risk assessment and management including the **problems of bias**\n\nDiscuss the application of the risk management control cycle\n\n* Relevance of **external influences** and **emerging risks**\n\nDiscuss how to **identify** **risks** and their **causes** and **implication**\n\nExplain what is meant by **risk** and **uncertainty** and discuss different definitions and **concepts of risk**\n\n***\n\nERM involves all risks faced by an organization\n\n**First step**: To determine and understand what risks the org. face\n\n* ***Process of risk identification*** \n\n    Incl. considerations of why each risk **arises** and an **initial assessment** of the impact it could have on the org.\n\nModule focus on the first part of the risk management control cycle\n\n1. **Business analysis**:  \n\n    Need to understand and know the specific characteristics of the org. and its operating environment before risk can be identified comprehensively\n\n2. **Risk identification**:  \n\n    Systematic process to identify the risks to which the org. is exposed\n\n3. **Initial assessment of risk**:  \n\n    Initial evaluation of the risks (quant. & qual.) to facilitate prioritization of appropriate risk management actions\n\n***Key discussion***:\n\n* Implementation\n\n* Methods and outputs of the process\n\n* Issues involved in identifying emerging risks (the problem of bias)\n\n(Again, this only covers up-to the initial assessment)\n\nNote: language on identification, assessment, evaluation, quantification can be use as being distinct or overlap in meaning\n\n## Risk Identification and Assessment Process\n\n6 steps of a comprehensive **risk identification** and **initial assessment** process\n\n1. ***Business analysis***\n\n    *Ensure* that the company has **clear business objectives**  \n    (Or else difficult to establish what risks can impact on their achievement)\n\n    Analyse its **operation** and its **wider environment**\n\n    * **Business plan**\n    \n    * Company's **structure** and system of **internal controls**\n    \n    * *Current* and *projected* **accounts** and accounting ratios\n    \n    * **Market information** (e.g. competitors actions and market share)\n    \n    * **Resources available** to the company\n    \n    * Legislative and **regulatory constraints**\n    \n    * General **economic environment**\n\n2. ***Identify the risks***\n\n    Identify up & down side risk **structurally**\n      \n    Start with a review of the **findings of the business analysis** to identify any areas or `risk`, `uncertainty` or `opportunity`\n      \n    See [next section](#risk-iden) for risk identification methods\n\n3. ***Obtain agreement***\n\n    Obtain agreement (with other stakeholders?) on the **risks faced**, **relationships** between them, and identify **individuals who will be responsible** for each risk and its management\n\n4. ***Evaluate the risks***\n\n    Evaluate in terms of **likelihood** and **severity** over a given time frame\n      \n    Can be done for both **gross** and **net of existing controls**\n      \n    Enable risks to be **prioritized** for further implementation of controls\n\n5. ***Produce a risk register***\n\n    **Record the results** of this process in one place\n      \n    Next section will further discuss elements of the [register](#risk-register)\n\n6. ***Review the risk register regularly***\n\n    Especially in times of change to ensure that it **remains up to date** and reflects the current risks faced by the company\n\n### Benefits of the Process\n\nImportant first step in the RM process:\n\n* *Enhances* **awareness** and **transparency** of risks\n\n* Helps **transfer knowledge** and **improve understanding** across the org.\n\n* Acts as a firm **base for subsequent risk analysis**, quantification and prioritization\n\n* **Enhances the quality of reporting** to the Board and senior management\n\n$\\therefore$ Helps improves business decision making\n\n### Requirements\n\nRequirements to gain the benefits above:\n\n* Need **senior sponsorship** of the RM program\n\n* Be **consistent** on the standards used **overtime**\n\n* Ensure **quantitative and qualitative** data is used so as to develop a comprehensive risk profile for the whole org.\n\n* **Integrate** risk identification with the entire RM process\n\n* **Demonstrate added value** (on top of meeting regulatory requirements)\n\n### Risk Assessment Process\n\n4 stage risk identification and assessment process (expansion of step 2 above)\n\n1. ***Foundation setting***\n\n    * *Get* **executive sponsorship**\n    \n    * *Organize* and *plan* for **resources**  \n    (e.g accountabilities and deadlines)\n    \n    * *Define* a **risk taxonomy**\n    \n    * *Build* a customized [**risk identification and assessment tool**](#risk-tool)\n    \n    * **Educate** and train project teams and management\n\n    **Potential pitfall**:\n\n    * Lack of senior management buy-in and participation\n    \n    * Bad resources planning and allocation\n    \n    * Insufficient preparation lead to an inefficient or ineffective process\n    \n2. ***Risk identification, assessment and prioritization***\n\n    * **Understand** `business objective`, `risk appetite`, `regulatory` and `policy requirements`\n\n    * Undertake **risk assessments**\n    \n        * Top down (e.g. interviews)\n        \n        * Bottom-up (e.g. workshops)\n\n    * Produce [risk reports and risk maps](#risk-concepts)\n  \n    * **Prioritize** risk\n\n    **Potential pitfall**:\n\n    * Lack of clear business objectives or risk appetite\n\n    * Focusing on consequences rather than **causes** of risk\n\n    * **Inconsistent estimate** of frequency and severity\n\n3. ***Deep dives, risk quantification and managment***\n\n    * Detailed assessments of of the **top risks** (prioritized from step 2.)\n\n    * *Produce* **risk tolerance** statements and **track KRIs**\n\n    * *Determine* **risk management strategies** and the **total cost of risk** (for pricing purpose)\n\n    **Potential pitfall**:\n\n    * Lack of prioritization of key risk\n    \n    * **Insufficient risk quantification**\n    \n    * Risk assessment **not translated into value adding action**\n\n4. ***Business and EMR integration***\n\n    * **Link risk assessment** with both `strategic planning` and `business review processes`\n\n    * **Integrate risk assessment** into *everyday business operations*  \n    (e.g. pricing and capital allocation)\n\n    * Conduct **scenario analysis** and **stress testing**\n\n    * **Report** on risk\n\n    * Creating and maintaining **loss/events databases**\n\n    * Establish appropriate **risk-escalation policies**\n\n    **Potential pitfall**:\n\n    * **Restricting integration** to low level reports\n    \n    * **Failure to fundamentally change the business attitude** to risk management\n\n***\n\nSee Lam App to Ch.23 with the **risk assessment self evalulation** checklist\n\n* How well developed and mature is the copany's risk identification and assessment\n\n* Degree of integration of RM across the org.\n\n## Risk Identification and Recording {#risk-iden}\n\n### Risk Identification Tools {#risk-tool}\n\n1. ***SWOT Analysis***\n\n    * Framework for generating ideas in a **structured** and comprehensive ways\n\n    * Consider `strengths`, `weakness`, `opportunities`, and `threats`\n\n    * Establish what risks the company faces\n\n2. ***Risk Checklist***\n\n    * **List of risk** identified in the **past** or from **external source**\n\n        Need to make sure the information is relevant and up to date\n\n3. ***Risk Prompt List***\n\n    * List of different **categories of risk** to consider and examples of each\n\n        * Can be produced at an industry wide level\n\n    * List `situations` and `events` that have **previously emerged** and that should be considered\n\n    * Similar to risk trigger questions\n\n    * e.g. PEST(ELI) analysis that covers:   \n    `Political`, `economic`, `social`, `technology` (`environmental`, `legal` and `industry`) risks\n\n4. ***Risk Taxonomy***\n\n    * Structured way of **classifying risks** and *breaking* them down into **components**\n\n    * Help to *ensure* that those involved in the process have a **common understanding of the terms used** in risk identification\n\n    * **Less project specific** than a `checklist` and **less industry specific** than an `industry prompt list`\n\n5. ***Case Studies***\n\n    * Can help to understand the impact of risks in a specific context\n\n6. ***Process Analysis***\n\n    * Build **flow charts** that detail **business process** and **links** between them\n\n    * Help identify the **risks that arise at each stage**\n\n    * **Particularly suited to op-risk**\n\n***\n\n***Advantages*** of the tools above:\n\n* Provide a **clear structure** for the risk identification process\n\n* *Improve* the **quality of the output** (vs a less structured process)\n\n***Disadvantage*** of the tools above:\n\n* Results may still **not be comprehensive**  \n(e.g. due to bias in the process or the participants)\n\n### Risk Identification Techniques\n\nActivities must be **well planned** and supported by a **positive risk culture**\n\n***Factors to consider on techniques***:\n\n1. **Who**\n\n    * Input is needed from **all areas of the business** to identify all risks and dependencies\n\n    * Select a diverse mix of people (role, experience and seniority)\n\n2. **How**\n\n    * Workshop, questionnaires\n\n    * Workshop types e.g. brainstorming\n\n    * External help in facilitation of workshops or design of questionnaires\n\n***\n\n***Risk identification techniques***\n\n1. ***Brainstorming***\n\n    Group of people generating ideas in a **free form** way\n\n    * **Facilitated** by an external consultant\n    \n    * Requires all participants to be in the same location at the same time\n\n    **Potential disadvantage**:\n\n    * If poorly run, can lead to **group think**\n\n    * **Uneven participation** can lead to an incomplete or biased identification of risks\n    \n    **Mitigation**:\n    \n    * Participants should come from various departments across the org. and have **different backgrounds**\n    \n    * **Outsiders** can bring fresh ideas even in specialist areas\n\n2. ***Independent group analysis***\n\n    * Each risk is **presented** by a member of the group and is then **discussed* by the group\n\n    * Each member then **rank each of the risk independently**\n      (to avoid group think)\n      \n    * Results are combined to form an **overall ranking**\n\n    **Potential disadvantage**:\n\n    * **Unbalanced group** may produce a biased list of risk and rankings\n\n3. ***Surveys***\n\n    Use online surveys to generate a wide range of responses cheaply and without collusion between participants\n\n    * Doesn't need everyone at the same place\n\n    **Potential disadvantage**:\n\n    * Problem of **framing**\n        \n        * Risk that the way the question is asked influences the response (can be mitigate by pilot surveys to help improve the design)\n    \n    * Poor **response rates**\n    \n    * Quality of the survey is only as good as both the **design and analysis of the response**\n    \n        e.g MC is easier to analyze but limit the range of possible responses\n\n4. ***Gap analysis***\n\n    * Type of questionnaire designed to identify the company's **current and desired risk exposures**\n\n    * `Line manager` might be best to identify the **current risk** while the `Board` is best to identify **desired risk**\n\n    **Potential disadvantage**:\n\n    * **Difficult and costly** to engage the Board in such a process\n\n5. ***Delphi technique***\n\n    A structured communication technique where the participants **answer questionnaires in 2 or more rounds**\n\n    * After each round, a facilitator provides an anonymous summary of the output from the previous round as well as the reasons they provided for their judgement\n\n    * Participants then revise their earlier answers in light of the replies of other members of the panel\n\n    **Intention**:\n    \n    During the revise process the range of answers will decrease and the group will converge towards a consensus\n\n    **Potential disadvantage**:\n\n    * Time consuming and costly\n\n6. ***Interviews***\n\n    Individuals are interviewed and the results collated by an independent external reviewer\n\n    * Can immediately clarify on responses\n\n    **Potential disadvantage**:\n\n    * **Time consuming** and expensive  \n    $\\hookrightarrow$ Restrictions on the number of interviews\n\n    * Having multiple interviewers can lead to **inconsistencies**\n\n7. ***Working groups***\n\n    Small numbers of **interested individuals** are tasked with **considering a specific risk** (or group of risk)\n\n    * Members are normally **specialists**\n\n    * Scope can extend to analysis of the risk identified, esp. if they are unquantifiable\n\n    **Potential disadvantage**:\n\n    * Identification will be **narrow** rather than comprehensive (As they are all specialist)\n      \n    * Specialist might want to work at a **higher level of precision than the cost is justified**\n\n### Risk Register {#risk-register}\n\nRisk should be collated in a risk register once identified\n\n***Key elements of risk register***\n\n* Labeling or **numbering system** to risk can be identify easily\n\n* **Category** of risk\n\n* **Description** of each risk (that is clear and understandable to all)\n\n* **Initial** assessment of the **likelihood** and **impact** over an applicable time frame\n\n* **Risk response action**  \n\n    (retain, remove, reduce, or transfer)\n    \n    Its cost and expected residual/secondary risk\n\n* Individual involved in *monitoring* and *managing* the risk  \n(**Risk owner**)\n\n* Document **control information**  \n(e.g. when was the last update and by whom)\n\n## Risk Concepts and Initial Risk Assessment Techniques {#risk-concepts}\n\n### Risk Concepts\n\n***Exposure***:\n\n* **Maximum loss** that can be suffered if an event occurs\n* Not limited to monetary damage\n\n***Volatility***\n\n* Measure of variability within the **range of possible outcome**\n* For market risk, it is referred to as the $\\sigma$ of returns\n\n***Probability***\n\n* Likelihood that an event occurs\n\n***Severity***\n\n* Loss that is likely to be incurred if an event occurs\n* Severity is generally lower than exposure\n* Combine with frequency we get the expected cost of risk\n\n***Time horizon***\n\n* Length of time for which an organization is exposed to a risk, or\n* Time required to recover from the event\n\n***Correlations***\n\n* Degree to which differing risks behave similarly in response to common events\n* Risk concentration results in high risk correlations\n    * Can be reduce by risk limits and checks and balances\n\n***Capital***\n\nCapital is held for:\n\n* Manage cash flow (**working capital**)\n\n* Facilitate growth (**development capital**)\n\n* Cover unexpected losses arising from exposure to risk (**risk capital**)\n\n***Purpose of risk capital***\n\n* **Financial strength** is judged by reference to the relative levels of risk and risk capital\n\n* For **debt holders**:  \n      \n    Provides **protection** against unexpected events  \n    \n    Determines **credit rating**\n\n* For **equity holders**:  \n\n    **Risk adjusted returns**: Returns should be judged relative to the level of risk capital (to adjust for risk)\n\n* **Allocation** of risk capital to operational units enables risk adjusted profitability to be determined and creates and \"internal capital market\" within the org.\n\n### Initial Risk Assessment Techniques\n\nSimple techniques for initial assessment\n\n#### Likelihood / Severity\n\n***Categorization***\n\nSee if the probability (or severity) of the risk event **falls within some pre-set categories**\n\n* Number of categories depend on the level of accuracy required from the exercise + extent the probabilities (severity) can be accurately estimated\n\n* Can use different probability distribution depending on the data available\n\n**Example**\n\n* Score frequency and severity:\n      \n    0-25%, 25%-50%, etc\n\n    low/mid/high, etc\n\n* Multiply together for a risk rating\n\n#### Risk Mapping\n\nPlots each risk on the risk map\n\n* Axes are the frequency and severity\n\n* Technique is used to **illustrate the effect** that each risk might have on an org.\n\n* Need to include all risks faced by the org.\n\n![](figures/figure-13.01.png)\n\n* A is the current level and A' is the residual level\n\n* Probability axis doesn't have to be continuous, can be broad like low/mid/high\n\n***Benefits***\n\n* Get people together across org. to **talk about risk**\n\n* *Improves* the enterprise's **understanding** of the risk it faces\n\n* *Improves* the **effect of its RM activities**\n\n* Shows which **risk require further attention**\n\n* Excellent **visual tool for reporting** to the Board on risk\n\n* Can show before (**inherent risk**) and after (**residual risk**) to highlight the **effectiveness of its risk control**\n\n#### Control Effectivenss - Heat Maps\n\nPlot **risk severity** against **control effectiveness** to show where action needs to be taken\n\n![](figures/figure-13.02.png)\n\n![](figures/figure-13.03.png)\n\n***Factors to rank risk controls*** according to their perceived **effectiveness**\n\n* Risk exposures are **within tolerance** levels\n\n* **Controls are in place**\n\n* Risks are **linked to potential impact on return**\n\n* **Risk metrics/dashboard reporting** is established\n\n## Emerging Risks\n\nEmerging risks are important and need to be fed into the overall control cycle along with any other external events and influences\n\n**Definition**:  \n**Developing** of already known risks which are subject to *uncertainty* and *ambiguity* and are therefore difficult to quantify using traditional risk assessment techniques\n\n* $\\Delta$ **nature of an existing** or **known risk**, or\n\n* $\\Delta$ **underlying effectiveness** of risk management approaches of an existing or known risk, or\n\n* **Development of a new risk**  \n(No explicit allowance in existing framework)\n    \n    Generally with much higher level of uncertainty\n    \n***Reasons why emerging risks are importants***:\n\n* Knowledge of such risks will **influence corporate strategy**\n\n* May **affect the profitability** of the organization\n\n* May yield **opportunities for a new product**\n\n***4 Key inter-related trends*** that give rise to emerging risk management challenges\n\n* **Globalization**:  \n\n    Increased **interdependence** of the world's economies and market\n\n* **Technology**:  \n\n    **New operational risks** from technology driven business\n\n* **Changing market structures**:  \n\n    As markets are **deregulated and privatized**\n\n* **Restructuring**:  \n\n    Effects of M&A and acquisition, joint ventures, outsourcing and business re-engineering\n\n### Examples\n\nEmerging risks of the past are known risks today  \n(e.g. cost of guaranteed annuity rates, health damage from asbestos)\n\nEmerging risk could include ***potential impact*** of:\n\n* Significant **shift in power** between *world economies* (and collapse of previously secure nations)\n\n* **Contagion** in asset markets\n\n* **Claims from unexpected sources**\n\n    * Nanotech\n    * Mobile phone use\n    * GMO food\n    * Cyber\n    * Terrorism (shifts in level and sources)\n    * Climate change\n    * Prolonged power blackouts\n    * Emerging infectious and pandemic diseases\n    * Unexpected changes in mortality or longevity\n    * etc.\n\n* Change in ways **information** is **stored** and **distributed** due to social media\n\n* **Unexpected behavior** of **financial guarantees embedded products**\n\n* **Non linear dependencies** between current known risks\n\n### Emerging IT Risks\n\nDue to increase reliance on computers and internet\n\n1. Cyber security\n\n2. Cloud computing\n\n3. Social media\n\n### Identification and Analysis\n\nAdditional issues arise from emerging risk than the standard process (identification, analysis, etc)\n\n* Need a more **holistic view** to identify emerging risk\n\n* Need to **consider all possible impacts** of the new risk before it can be reduced to the more structured approach like the other risk\n\n***Horizon Scanning***\n\n* Key tool for identifying emerging risk\n\n* Systematic search for potential developments over the longer term\n\n* Emphasis on **changes that are at the edges of current thinking**\n\n* **Requires input from experts** that understand the underlying drivers and the tech/science/econ/socioecon aspects\n\n    * Alternatively (expert not available or too costly) can rely on relevant external sources (e.g. academic journals)\n\n***Weighing different underlying evidence***\n\n* There won't be definitive study on the emerging risk\n\n    $\\therefore$ need to assess from different angles and sources\n\n* Need to weight RM decisions according to the credibility and reliability of the underlying evidence\n\n* Important to **continue monitor developments** in relevant research to refresh past decisions\n\n* **Beware of alarmist media reports**\n\n    * Useful for alerting of potential areas of further investigation\n\n    * Should not be used as a basis for decision making\n\n***Additional source of uncertainty***\n\n* Added layer of uncertainty for companies impacted by likely **future legal approaches** to the emerging factors\n\n    Active identification and consideration of such emerging risks will ready company to meet and react to such risks\n\n* Analysis of **trends** is important\n \n    * **Monitor regulatory and lobbying activity** in the sector by relevant experts\n\n    * Important to **keep dependencies in mind** as changes can lead to reduction in diversification\n\n## Bias\n\n***Problem of bias***:  \nRisks not being identified, assessed or reported in a true and honest way\n\n* Can be due to **lack of supportive risk culture** (o rsub optimal culture)\n\n* Often in the context of **project appraisal**\n\n### Sources of Bias\n\n***Intentional*** bias:  \ne.g. deliberate underestimation of risk to achieve a specific personal goal\n\n***Unintentional*** bias:  \ne.g. inaccurate assessment of risk due to lack of experience or time\n\n***Encountering bias***:\n\n* Reporting to the Board about the ongoing risks facing the enterprise\n\n* Project appraisal where the project champions tend to minimize the risks in hope of getting approval\n\n***Ways in which bias are introduced into project appraisal*** (by accident or design):\n\n* Insufficient care to the identification or analysis of risk\n\n* Omission of key risks (Accidental or deliberate)\n\n* Incorrect assumptions of independence\n\n* Underestimate likelihood due to inadequate past experience\n\n* Deliberately over optimistic cash flows (or just guessing)\n\n* Not accounting for future economic cycle\n\n* Inadequate attention to risk with new technologies\n\n* Not considering all the effects of the project on the sponsor's other business\n\n* Credit taken for benefits not directly attributable to the project\n\n* Assumptions not correspond with sr mgmt's view of the world in the future\n\n* Spreadsheets error lead to failures of logic\n\n### Behavioral Finance\n\nStudy of ***unintentional bias in finance***\n\n* Looks at how a variety of **mental biases** and **decision making errors** affect financial decisions\n\n* Relates to the psychology that underlies and drives financial decision making behavior\n\n* Evidence suggest that investors do not always act rationally contrary to tradtional economic theory assumptions\n\n***3 types of behavioral bias***\n\n1. ***Overconfidence***:\n\n    People Tend to overestimate their own abilities, knowledge and skills\n\n2. **Anchoring**:  \n\n    People based perceptions on past experience or \"expert\" opinion\n\n3. **Representative heuristics**:\n\n    People find more probable those things that they find easier to imagine\n\n[Other examples](http://www.sias.org.uk/view_paper?id=BehaviouralFinance) \n\n### Avoiding Bias\n\n**Built in checks and balances** can prevent the danger above\n\n***Key step to minimize the risk of bias***:\n\n* **Validate the appraisal work** (esp. cash flow) by competent and independent checking\n\n* **Reference** where possible to the outcomes of **similar projects**\n\n***Build in additional capital cost***:\n\n* **Load in a %** to the capital cost based on past experience\n\n* **Reduce estimated return**\n\n    * **Caveat**: \n    \n        If the project is to proceed, it give the PMO a large contingency allowance in the capital cost  \n        $\\therefore$ reducing incentives to keep capital costs to a minimum",
