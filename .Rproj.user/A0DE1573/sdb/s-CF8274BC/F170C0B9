Policy and infrastructure\n2. Credit granting\n3. Exposure monitoring, management and reporting\n4. Portfolio management\n5. Credit review\n\n#### Policy and Infrastructure\n\n**Goal** of this stage:   \nTo have **documented** credit **policies** and **procedures** to ensure credit risk can be effectively `identified`, `measured`, `monitored`, `controlled` and `reported`\n\n1. **Establishing** an `appropriate credit environment`\n2. **Adopting** credit risk `policies` and `procedures`\n    * Appropriate to the company's business context\n    * Address a range of topics\n    * Adopted by senior management\n3. **Implementing** credit risk `policies` and `procedures`\n    * Communicate to all relevant employees\n    * Review at least annually to reflect any change in the business context\n4. Developing **methodologies** and models with appropriate systems\n5. Defining **data standards** and **conventions**\n\n#### Credit Granting\n\nExtending credit to customers or other counterparties:\n\n* Credit **analysis/rating** of counterparties\n* Credit **approval**\n* **Pricing** and setting **term and conditions** for credit\n* **Documentation**\n\nCredit rating can be applied to the transaction or to the counterparty\n\n***Characteristics of an effective and efficient credit rating system***:\n\n* Strike a **balance** between `effectiveness` (accurate, consistent and timely) and `efficiency` (low cost)\n* May be based on pure `judegement` or `deterministic modeling` (or both)\n* Should **respond to changes** in circumstances of the counterparty (e.g. ratings being review regularly)\n\nRatings should reflect the following **factors**:\n\n* Borrower's repayment **history**\n* Analysis of the borrower's **ability to pay**\n* **Reputation**\n* Availability and enforceability of **guarantees** or **collateral**\n\n#### Exposure Monitoring, Management and Reporting\n\n**Purpose** of this stage:\n\n* **Prevent undue exposure** to and individual counterparty\n* Ensure appropriate **portfolio diversification**\n* Provide early warning of possible adverse credit events  \n(e.g. monitor indicators such as credit spreads and stock price volatility)\n\n***2 types of credit exposure***:\n\n1. **Current exposure**: amount of risk today if all credit transactions were settled and credit assets sold\n2. **Potential exposure**: amount that may be at risk in the future, which is likely to be a function of time to maturity and volatility of the underlying instrument\n\nExposure may be calculated from the current exposure or using some rule of thumb (important to take consistent approach)\n\n***Exposure limits***\n\nAvoid concentration of risk in a single counterparties, connected counterparties and other groupings\n\nActual credit exposure should be compared to the limits\n\n**4 uses** of exposure limits:\n\n1. **Risk control**: prevent from engaging in overly risky business activities\n2. **Allocation of risk bearing capacity**: limits should reflect management's assessment of risk/return trade off\n3. **Delegation of authority**: ensure credit decisions are made by those with the appropriate skill and delegated authority\n4. **Regulatory compliance**: regulators maintain close scrutiny of credit risk controls\n\nBest practice credit risk **reporting**\n\n* Relevant and timely\n* Reliable\n* Comparable\n* Material\n\nShould includes\n\n* Trends\n* Risk-adjusted profitability\n* Large individual exposures\n* Aggregate exposures\n* Exceptions\n\n#### Portfolio Management\n\nCredit portfolio management function:\n\n* **Optimize** the desired risk/return trade offs by defining a `target portfolio`\n* Historically credit risk stayed on the company's b/s until settlement of the transaction\n* Strategies and financial vehicles used for portfolio management includes:\n    * **Buying or selling** assets\n    * **Securitizing** assets\n    * **Hedging** risks using derivatives\n    * **Transferring** risk\n    \nCurrent trend is to **disaggregate** the business into `origination`, `portfolio management` and `servicing`\n\n* Enables loans to be packaged into various asset-backed securities and introduces market discipline and feedback on underwriting, pricing and documentation as separate business components\n* However, a lack of controls across these dis-aggregated business components is one of the key reasons for the credit crisis\n\n#### Credit Review\n\nRole:\n\n* Review a sample of transactions and associated documentation to ensure data is correct\n* Test that systems are working\n* Enforce underwriting standards\n* Check policies and procedures are being followed\n\nResults of the review should be communicated to management\n\n* Any exceptions or deficiencies should be highlighted, along with the established timeframes for their resolution\n\n### Best Practices\n\n| Level | Basic | Standard | Best |\n| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |\n| Credit risk ratings | **Common definitions** of risk and exposure measurement across the business, very **few risk ratings**, focus on **individual transactions** | Better risk rating **linking** into `pricing`, `reserve` and `capital requirements`; Credit exposure **limits** by `counterparty`, `industry`, `country` | Risk managed at **individual`** transaction and **portfolio** level |\n| Modeling | Simple **spreadsheet** models and credit bureau reports | **Internal** and **3^rd^ party** model consider a **variety of indicators** | **Sophisticated tools** incl. `simulation` models, `scenario` analysis and planning, `advanced credit scoring`, `surveillance` and `migration` models |\n| Credit risk function | `Policy`, `approval` and `monitoring` | More **integration** into `loan origination`; Performance measured by **risk-adjusted** profitability of BU | **Centralized active portfolio management** aim to **optimize** portfolio risk/return, **strong credit culture** |\n\nThe level of sophistication required depends on the risk profile of the company\n\nEven best practice companies can build up dangerous levels of concentration of risk\n\n## Credit Risk Management Techniques\n\n**Underwriting** and **due diligence** facilitate decisions as to the appropriate types of response to a particular credit risk exposure (i.e. avoidance, acceptance, transfer and or management)\n\n**Transfer** of credit risk is often achieved by `credit insurance`, `credit derivatives` and or by the `securitization` of assets\n\n### Underwriting\n\n**Approaches** to check creditworthiness\n\n* **Credit scoring** approach (mod 23)\n* **Component analysis** technique (mod 19)\n* **3^rd^ party ratings** (e.g. Moody's or Experian)\n\n2 potential **outcomes** of underwriting\n\n1. **Decision** (e.g. approve or denied)\n2. What **terms** should be placed on the loan (e.g. interest rate, requirement to provide collateral)\n\n### Due Diligence\n\nDue diligence refers to the care a reasonable person should take before entering into any agreement or transaction with another party\n\n* Should be done when a company enter into a major agreement with a 3^rd^ party\n* Degree of due diligence varies depending on the type of relationship and value of the transaction\n* Generally covers a wide range of factors (e.g. public and internal documents) including subjective information (e.g. interview with management and other stakeholders)\n* Can be expensive and time consuming\n\nProcess is very similar to that undertaken by credit-rating agencies when determining a rating\n\n2 potential **outcome** of due diligence\n\n1. Avoidance of exposure to the counterparty\n2. Acting to limit exposure (e.g. through careful payment schedule)\n\nOptional reading of an extensive due diligence checklist: \"The Financial Risk Manual - A Systematic Guide to Identifying and Managing Financial Risk\" J Holliwell\n\n### Credit Insurance\n\nOne way to mitigate large exposures to particular types of credit risk\n\n* Particularly for **incidental credit risk** (not related to core business)\n\n**Benefits** of credit insurance\n\n1. Protection against some or all bed debts\n2. Cover for some or all debtors\n3. Cover for domestic or international trade\n4. Specialist advice based on the experience of the insurer\n5. Cover for expenses incurred\n6. International cover for country risk, debt recovery services and any losses on forward foreign exchange commitments\n7. Ability to secure better terms for financing (help to offset the cost of the insurance)\n\nCost of the insurance will take into account the industry sector, the country risk, the nature of the goods and services, the term of trade and the track record of existing buyers\n\nWhen settling claims the insurer will ensure that the goods and services have actually been provided, that the debt exists, that credit limits have not been exceeded and of course, that the insurance premium has been paid\n\n### Credit Derivatives\n\n2 types of instrument that can be used to manage credit risk are Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and Total Rate of Return Swaps (TRORS)\n\nLiquidity of both the TRORS and CDS maybe better than the underlying asset $\\Rightarrow$ Advantage of using them as hedging tools rather than directly selling the underlying credit risk in the cash markets\n\nBoth TRORS and CDS introduce counterparty risk\n\n#### CDS\n\nUse case:\n\n* Lenders who have reached their internal credit limit with a particular client but wish to maintain their relationship with the client cans use CDW\n* e.g. CDS give Bank X the right to sell a bond, which was issued by Company Y to Bank Z for the face value of the bond should Company Y experience a pre-specified type of credit event\n\n**Types of Credit Events**\n\n* Bankruptcy (e.g. insolvency, winding-up, appointment of a receiver)\n* Rating downgrade\n* Repudiation  \n(when debt issuer simply chooses to cancel all of the o/s interest payments and the capital repayment of the debt)\n* Failure to pay a particular coupon\n* Cross-default  \n(a cross default clause on a bond means that a credit event on another security of the issuing firm will also be considered a credit even on the referenced bond)\n\n***CDS Structure***\n\n* Payment of a fee (single or regular) by the party that is looking to hedge to the party that is selling the protection\n* Seller of the protection will make a credit default protection payment if a credit default event on the reference asset occurs within the term of the contract\n* Hedge the default risk but does not explicitly hedge the price risk\n\n**Settlement types**\n\n* **Cash settlement**: Amount of the protection payment = `original price` of the reference asset - `recovery value` of the reference asset\n    \n    **Disadvantage**:\n    \n    * Recovery process takes time, may invoke uncertain cost for the CDS owner and the ultimate recovery amount is uncertain\n    * Contract needs to clearly state what is the recovery value; If it's the market value, it is important to specify the time\n    \n* **Physical settlement**: the seller pays the full notional amount and receives the defaulted security\n    \n    **Disadvantage**: will be more costly than cash settlement\n    \nCDS contract can reference a portfolio of bonds or a whole bond index\n\nBuyer of CDS may not have any insurable interest (no exposure to the reference entity) $\\Rightarrow$ CDS can be used as an alternative to short-selling the reference asset\n\n#### TRORS\n\nTotal rate of return swaps (total return swaps) can hedge both `price` and `default` risk\n\n* Total return from one asset (or group of asset) is swapped for the return on another\n* This creates a hedge for both market (price) risk and credit (default) risk of the reference assets\n* Investors who cannot short securities maybe be able to hedge a long position by paying the total rate of return in a TRORS\n\nUse case:\n\n* **Increase diversification**: Swapping one type of exposure for another without physically swapping the underlying assets\n* **Manage specific risk** (e.g. credit risk)\n\ne.g.\n\n* A owns a risk bond\n* A pay coupons from bond to bank C\n* Bank C pays A LIBOR + 2%\n* If B doesn't default, A pay additional payment to C = increase in the value of the bond\n* If B default, C will receive from A a net payment on default based on the face value of bond B less recovery\n\n### Securitization\n\nInvolves pooling together a group of assets, combined with the issue of one or more tranches of asset backed securities (ABS)\n\n* Cashflows generated by the pool of assets are used to service the interest and capital payments on the ABS\n\n#### Structure\n\nFramework of securitization:\n\n1. Originator sells those assets to a special purpose vehicle (SPV)\n2. SPV raises the funds to purchase the assets by issuing debt securities such as bonds to investors (these are the ABS)\n3. The receivables transferred into the SPV meet the principal and interest liabilities on the debt securities\n    * SPV may grant security over the receivables to secure its obligation to repay principal and interest\n    * In which case, investor in the SPV would be entitled to claim the underlying assets in the event of default\n    \nSPV will be structured to be bankruptcy remote in the event of the failure of the borrower (i.e. it is a separately legal entity, usually a company in its own right)\n\n* Hence in the event of the default by the SPV, the investors has no recourse to the assets of the original owner and vice versa\n\n**Example**\n\n![](figures/figure-28.01.png)\n\n* Company X sells the secured assets that will generate the future income stream to the SPV\n* SPV raises the required funds to purchase them by issuing (asset backed) bonds to investors\n* Cashflow generated by the secured assets is then paid to the SPV, which in turn uses them to meet the interest and capital payments on the ABS\n\n#### Benefits\n\n1. Converts a bundle of assets into a structured financial instrument which is then negotiable\n2. A way for a company to raise money, that is linked directly to the cashflow receipts that it anticipate receiving in the future\n3. An alternate source of finance to issuing \"normal\" secured or unsecured bonds\n4. A way of passing the risk in the assets to a 3^rd^ party, removing them from the b/s and reducing capital\n5. A way of effectively selling exposure to what may be an otherwise unmarketable pool of assets\n\n#### Types of Securitized Assets\n\nOriginally they are **homogeneous** debt obligations (residential mortgages or trade receivables) subject to relatively **simple terms and conditions**\n\nScope of securitization and ABS grew rapidly prior to the credit crunch\n\nExamples of ABS\n\n* **MBS** residential and commercial mortgage backed securities:  \nPayments are secured or collateralized on the interest and capital payments made under mortgages used to buy property\n* **CCABS** credit card receivables:  \nBased on the payments made by credit card holders to the credit card company\n* **CLO, CBO, CDO** Collateralized loan, bond and debt obligations:  \nTypically collateralized on existing bank loans, bonds and a mixture of both bank loans and bonds respectively\n* **Insurance securitization**:  \nBacked by the receivables arising from an insurance book\n\nAlmost any assets that generate a reasonably predictable income stream can in theory be used as the basis of an ABS\n\n#### Tranches\n\nBorrowing are normally made in a multi tranche format with credit ratings or credit default protection obtained for at least the major tranches\n\n* Tranches are repaid according to the rules laid down in the documentation\n* Actual returns will depend on the actual timing of repayments on the underlying assets, any early repayments and any default losses and recoveries\n* Expected returns on each tranche are highly sensitive to the choice of model/parameters used to project these uncertain future cashflows\n\nBy working with credit rating agencies to structure the bond tranches in the way that best meets the various risk and return requirements of the different potential investors, it may be possible to reduce the overall cost of borrowing (i.e. raise a greater price in exchange for the transfer of assets to the SPV)\n\nCashflows from the underlying portfolio might be used to create:\n\n* Bond with fixed coupon rate:  \nMost **senior** security and its coupons are paid first  \nSenior debt that might carry AAA rating\n* Bond whose coupons are paid as long as there is enough left from the senior debt:  \n**Mezzanine** tranche, typically BB rating\n* Claim on the residual  cashflows from the original portfolio after the 2 senior classes are paid  \nHigh yield speculative bond, **equity** claim\n\nSuch a tranched structure is called a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) if the underlying assets are bank loans and or bonds\n* Similar structure involving a number of different tranches of ABS can be used irrespective of the underlying securitized assets\n\n***Key benefit***\n\n* They combine the credit risks of different instruments into a portfolio which is then divided and repackaged as several new securities with credit risk features different to the underlying instruments\n* These alternative features may be more attractive to particular investors and so the proceeds of the securitization will be higher than if the underlying instruments had been securitized as a single tranche\n\n#### Credit-linked Note\n\nCLN is a collateralized vehicle consisting of a bond with an embedded CDS\n\nCan be used by the holder of corporate bonds (protection buyer) to transfer the credit risk on those bonds (reference asset) to other investors\n\nProcess:\n\n1. Setting up an SPV\n2. Sells the CLNs to investors\n3. Uses the proceeds to buy risk-free government bonds\n4. SPV also sells a CDS based on the original corporate bonds to the original bondholder\n\nInvestors receive a total return based on the CDS premium income and the yield on the risk-free bond\n\nIn return, their capital is at risk and may be required to recompensate the protection buyer in the event of a default on the reference bonds\n\n![](figures/figure-28.02.png)\n\nIf the CLNs are in a multi-tranche format then they provide not only a useful way of transferring credit risk but also a mean of repackaging credit risk\n\n**CLN vs CDS**\n\n* CLN may be more attractive to investors (protection seller) who are not able to sell credit derivatives (due to internal or external constraints) but who are able to buy CLNs (if classified as bonds rather than credit derivatives)\n\n## Managing Creditworthiness\n\nCompany can manage the level of credit risk to which it exposes its own stakeholders by adjusting:\n\n* Capital structure\n* Mix and volume of business if writes\n\nEntities can manage its own credit risk by raising (or distributing) capital, approach varies by entity types:\n\n* **Investment banks**:  \nWork backwards from the volumes of business they expect to write and their target credit rating to determine the amount of debt capital they need to hold\n* **Insurance companies**:  \nFollow a similar approach as investment bank but on a less tactical basis; The raising (or distributing) of capital is more likely to result from strategic reviews (e.g. business mix)\n* **Pension funds**:  \nWill link capital decisions (affecting contribution rates, benefit levels and the mix of capital by source) to reviews of investment strategy  \nThey will be made in the light of the strength of the sponsor covenant and any alternative methods of contribution to cash payments that are being used\n\nGenerally speaking, most orgs cannot change their capital base as readily as investment banks\n\n3 ways in which a business whose capital base is fixed can improve its creditworthiness:\n\n1. Writing less of the same business, hence conserving capital\n2. Changing the mix within each particular class of business, which may have a diversifying effect (e.g. improve geographic spread)\n3. Changing the mix between the various class of business, again to diversify across classes with low correlations",
