Lau\"\ndate: \"`r format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y')`\"\noutput: \n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    toc_float:\n      collapsed: false\n      smooth_scroll: false\n    toc_depth: 4\n---\n\n## Module Objective\n\nDiscuss the management of operational, liquidity, insurance and other key risks\n\n***\n\nneed to be able to recommend simple strategies to managing specific types of op-risk\n\nNote that the Emerging IT risk from Lam was covered in Mod 13\n\n## Controlling Specific Types of Op-Risk\n\nOp-risk is the most dangerous risk that companies must control\n\n* e.g. Rogue traders at Société Générale, Barings, NAB and AIB\n* Baring and other case studies in Mod 32\n\nNeed an op-risk framework that is integrated into the business\n\n* More important to control the op-risk through a sound RM process (i.e. `identity`, `assess`, `report`) than trying to quantify the risks\n\n***Controls***\n\nKey to manage op-risk is to have **sufficient controls** in the business\n\n**Controls**: Combination of **information**, **assessment** and **response**  \n(i.e. what information do we have that we can use to decide what course of action to take)\n\n***Desirable characteristics of controls***\n\n1. Focus on **results**\n2. In place for **both** `measurable` and `non-measurable` events\n3. **Standardized** for efficient communication\n4. **High quality** so as to improve management\n5. **Few**, rather than many\n6. **Meaningful** and **appropriate**\n7. **Timely** so as to give sufficient warning\n8. **Simple** so they are easily understood\n\nRecall discussions of external control frameworks (e.g. COSO) in Mod 5-7\n\n### Outsourcing\n\nCompanies now outsource non-core activities to 3^rd^ party\n\n**Risks** that outsourcing brings:\n\n* Possible **failure** of the 3^rd^ party to deliver its commitments\n* **Reduced control** it has over the `processes` and `people` in the 3^rd^ party\n\n**Considerations** for entering into an outsourcing agreement\n\n1. **Regulatory evnironment** and the **status** of the 3^rd^ party\n2. **Financial standing** of the 3^rd^ party\n3. **Competency**, **business continuity plans** and **risk processes** of the 3^rd^ party\n4. **Legal agreement** with the 3^rd^ party (incl. `right to terminate`, 3^rd^ party's `right to sub-contract`)\n5. How it will **monitor** the 3^rd^ party\n\n### External Events\n\nNeed to pay attention to the innumerable external risks that can disrupt the operation of the business\n\n1. **Loss of IT** or telephony capacity\n2. **Loss** of `people` and `skills`\n3. **Bad PR** or negative publicity\n4. **Disruption** to `supply chain`\n5. **Natural disaster**: Fire/flooding/high winds\n6. **Protest** from pressure groups (e.g. animal rights)\n7. **Terrorist** damage\n\n### Business Continuity and Crisis Management\n\n**Business continuity**:  \nIncludes **safeguarding** the business's `reputation`, `brand` and other `value creating activities`\n\n***Business Continuity Plan (BCP)***\n\n* Response to the business interruptions risk identified\n* Need to be test regularly\n* Can be used to reassure stakeholders that business interruption risks can be managed\n* May result in pre-emptive actions including: offsite backup, redundant office block and computer systems ready\n\n***Crisis Management Plan (CMP)***\n\n* Ensure a clear and organized response in the event of a significant incident\n* Crisis Management Group will take control of an issue and co-ordinate action\n\n***\n\nHigh degree of preparedness ensures that a company can take advantage of unexpected gains, or stem losses in the event of a critical incident\n\nBusiness may also purchase consequential loss insurance so as to obtain compensation for loss of profits during the period of business disruption\n\n### Regulatory and Legal Risks\n\nImpact can be significant, incl. `fines`, `reputational damage` and `loss of authorization to trade`\n\nActives to ***manage regulatory and legal risk***:\n\n1. **Keep abreast of change** to `regulations` and `laws` and to be aware of impending changes and their **likely impact**\n2. **Influence** changes through `lobbying` activities (directly or indirectly through industry bodies)\n\n### Technology Risk\n\nTechnology and cyber-crime risk management actions:\n\n1. Keeping systems **up-to-date**  \n(balance functionality with costs)\n2. Routine **maintenance**  \n(esp for IT solutions developed in house)\n3. Thorough **testing** (for robustness and compatibility) when introducing new IT systems\n4. Quick response **IT helpdesk** to deal with minor IT issues\n5. **Training** staff  \n(e.g. not to open suspicious email)\n6. **Restrictions** on employees' use of `social media` applications or use of `devices` (e.g. USB drives) that might circumvent IT security\n7. Implementing and testing **security software and routines** such as `firewall`, `backups` and `regular password changes` to prevent cyber attacks and ensure data can be rapidly recovered in the event of loss\n\ne.g. phishing attacks can be mitigate by using separate computers\n\n### Crime Risk\n\nManagement of this should reflect the severity\n\n* Covers a wide spectrum from petty theft to major fraud\n\nIt is possible to spend more money managing the risk of small losses than is saved by the control\n\n* However some business take the view that rules to prevent even minor dishonesty (such as taking stationary) should be rigorously enforced as evidence of the company's zero-tolerance culture\n\n### People Risk\n\n#### Employment-Related\n\n**People risk**: incl. behavior of the business to its people as well as the behavior of the people to the business\n\nEmployment related people risk can be managed through appropriate:\n\n* **Recruitment processes**\n    * Cost effective recruitment of the right individuals\n    * Enforceable contracts of employment\n* **Competency management processes**\n    * Training requirements (incl. new employee induction, CPD and professional qualifications)\n    * Risk training increases the understanding of risk management in the business\n* **Appraisals and performance management processes**\n    * Talent management (i.e. promotion and transfer)\n    * Retention of the right employee\n    * identification of poor performers, subsequent support and possible disciplinary action\n    * NEDs should regularly appraise their skills, knowledge and expertise and undertake professional development where necessary\n* **Relationship management**\n    * With employee related collective bodies (e.g. unions)\n    \n#### Adverse Selection\n\nSimilar to insurance where the need to distinguish between different customers who present different risk in order to prevent being selected against\n\n* e.g. bank that offers free banking to all customers runs the risk of being adversely selected by low-balance, high activity customers\n\n***Managing adverse selection***\n\nRisk of adverse selection can be managed by careful **underwriting** and **product design** and **pricing**\n\n#### Moral Hazard\n\n**Mora hazard** can occur when one person makes the decision about how much risk to take while someone else bears the cost if things go wrong\n\n* Closely related to agency risk\n* In insurance, it is the risk that an insured, having obtained cover, may act in a way that is of detriment to the insurer (e.g. fail to act with due caution)\n\n***Managing moral hazard***\n\n* Making the consequences unattractive (e.g. co-insurance)\n* Prevention (e.g. ensuring insurable interest in life insurance)\n\n#### Agency risk\n\nRecall discussion from Mod 11\n\n***Managing agency risk***\n\n* \"Sticks\": (e.g. corporate governance policies)\n* \"Carrots\": (e.g. alignment of agents interest perhaps through share-based remuneration)\n\nBUs maybe incentivised to improve op-risk management if operational risk is included in the allocation of economic capital (hence reducing their capital charges)\n\n### Bias\n\nRecall problem of bias in Mod 13\n\nTo avoid bias:\n\n* Checks and balance should be built into the system\n* Assessments should be subjected to competent and genuinely independent checking\n* Consider introducing an optimism bias into the appraisal of capital projects\n* Educate people about the problem of unintentional bias\n\n### Process Risk (Change Management)\n\nIntroduction of changes into the business processes or IT systems introduces the risk to the business that the new processes or systems fail or be poorly implemented\n\n***Managing process risk***\n\n* Undertaking pilot studies\n* Precise definition of the requirements of any new solution to best meet the needs of the whole enterprise\n* Designing systems that can be easily maintained, enhanced and upgraded\n* Careful deployment of the new systems with user education\n\nStress test of any new process or system should be done both in isolation of and within the larger structure into which it is to be placed\n\nHaving been introduced, processes should be reviewed regularly for effectiveness\n\n### Model Risk and Data Risk\n\nRecall discussion from Mod 21\n\n***Managing model risk***\n\n* Have documented processes for model building and testing\n* Have clear audit trails and change management routines\n* Use models only for their intended purpose\n\n***Managing data risk***\n\n* Limit what can be entered to what is valid\n* Check data entry\n* Re-check data on transfer and in particular, de-duplicate\n\n[Optional reading](#http://www.derivativesstrategy.com/magazine/archive/1997/0697fea1.asp)\n\n### Reputational Risk\n\n***Defense against reputational risk***\n\n* Sound ERM framework\n* Business continuity and crisis management plans and processes\n* Strong relationships with key stakeholders\n\n## Operational Risk Mitigation and Control\n\nThere is no upside to op-risk but a cost-benefit analysis may result in some operational risks being accepted rather than mitigated\n\n#### Risk Transfer\n\nFor critical op-risk a company must decide whether to retain the risk or transfer (or both)\n\n* Ceding the risk should lead to lower expected losses and reduced volatility\n* Ceding will incur the cost of insurance premium and additional counterparty risk\n\n***Enterprise wide process for op-risk transfer***:\n\n1. **Identify** op-risk exposure\n2. **Quantify** their probabilities, severities and economic capital requirements\n3. **Integrate** the op-risk with credit and market risk to establish an **enterprise wide risk profile**\n4. Establish op-risk **limits**\n5. Implement internal **controls**\n6. Develop `risk transfer` and `financing` **strategies**\n7. **Evaluate alternative** `providers` and `structures` based on a cost/benefit analysis\n    * Company may compare the ceded risk-adjusted return on capital to the cost of equity to see if the strategy enhances s/h value\n    \n#### Retained Op-Risk\n\nSome companies self-insure against op-losses by establishing reserves\n\n* Cost of the reserve and cost of other risk management actions should be factored into produce pricing based on target risk adjusted return\n\n#### Best Practices\n\n| Level | Basic | Standard | Best |\n| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------|\n| Operational risks | `Loss indicators` are reported | Full set of risk indicators by BUs with **goals** and **minimum acceptable performance** targets; **Early warning** indicators developed | **Broad definition** of op-risk; **Internal** and **external** `early warning` indicators; **Economic capital** allocated to op-risk |\n| Systems | Losses are **tracked** | Op-risk database **linked** to `industry` database | **Qualitative** and **quantitative** tools incl. scenario and simulation risk models |\n| Op-risk function | `Op-risk manager` and `committee` in place; `Audit` and `compliance` **police the policies** | **Team of risk professionals**; **Response and contingency plans** developed; Audit is independent | `Insurance function` **fully integrated** with op-risk function |\n\n## Management of Other Risks\n\nConsider management of liquidity, systemic, demographic and insurance risks\n\n### Liquidity Risk\n\nRequires a company to actively monitor its liquidity requirements\n\n* It must know how much cash it will need in the short/medium term\n* Check it has sufficient cash-like assets\n\nMonitoring must be both within and across legal entities\n\n* Differing transferability of liquidity assets (or fungibility) due to exchange and other regulatory barriers is a particular difficulty for multi nationals\n\n***Methods of managing mark liquidity risk***\n\n* Varying investment strategy\n* Using swaps\n* Having a contingency fund consisting of high-quality, liquid assets\n\n***Methods of managing mark funding risk***  \n(Should be considered alongside credit risks for banks)\n\n* Diversifying sources of funding (by type and term)\n* Continuously monitoring the ability to raise additional capital\n* Contingency sources of funding from their banks (e.g. line of credit) to draw upon in times of stress\n\n### Systemic Risk\n\nBusiness can manage some systemic risks by ensuring it deals with a wide range of counterparties (avoid concentration)\n\n* Internal limits can ensure undue exposure to a specific counterparty/industry sectors is limited\n\nActivities to **reduce or eliminate feedback risk** (spread of risk through a financial system)\n\n* Investing only in exchange-traded instruments, so as to pool counterparty risk\n* Suspension of trading on the stock exchange by circuit breakers if there is a large market movement\n* Governments of central banks intervening to prop up a bank (by acting as a lender of last resort) or reduce financial consequences (e.g. by reducing interest rate)\n* Regulations that require establishment of additional reserve (e.g. Basel III requires companies to build up additional reserves in the good times)\n* Avoid regulations that increase pro-cyclicality (e.g. solvency regulation that encourage all similar organization to adopt similar investment and risk-mitigation strategies)\n* Physically separating types of business (e.g. the separation of investment banking and retail banking under the US 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which was repealed but is now being actively pursued following the financial crisis)\n\n### Demographic Risk and Non-life Insurance Risk\n\n***Managing demographic or non-life insurance risk***\n\n* Before the risk is accepted (e.g. through underwriting)\n* After the risk has been accepted\n    * Risk transfer (e.g. reinsurance, annuities, longevity swap, securitization)\n    * Reduce risk concentration (e.g. by growing business)\n    * Improved diversification (e.g. by LoB)\n    * Implied hedging (e.g. mortality and longevity)\n    \nMany of the ART (Mod 26 are designed to manage these risk)",
