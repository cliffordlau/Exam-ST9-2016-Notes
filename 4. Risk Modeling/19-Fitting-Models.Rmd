## Module Objective

Recommend a specific choice of model based on the results of both quantitative and qualitative analysis of financial or insurance data

***

Short list a number of possible (candidat) models (based on certain features of the data)

* E.g. tail dependence shown in the data will indicate which choices of copula

This module focus on how each candidate model might be fitted to the data set

1. Select the method of fitting
2. Evaluate the goodness of fit
    * For the model as a whole
    * For each of the explanatory variables
    * Use both quantitative and qualitative methods
3. Final model selection

First consider the fitting of a distribution to a given data set, then go on to look at the fitting of more complex models to a data set

Exam note:

* Key objective is to be able to recommend a specific choice of model or models for further analysis of specific problems
* Recommendation needs to be made on the basis of a variety of quantitative measures as well as qualitative analysis

## Fitting a Distribution to Data

### Method of Moments

#### Univariate Distribution

Parameterization of Univariate Distribution

Establish the parameters of a distribution empirically by looking at the sample moments and equating these to the population (or true) moments

E.g. for a distribution with 3 parameters and $n$ data points $x_1,...,x_n$

* Set $\mathrm{E}(X) = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum x_i$; $\mathrm{E}(X^2) = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum x_i^2$; $\mathrm{E}(X^3) = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum x_i^3$
* Solve the equations simultaneously to obtain the parameter values needed to specify the distribution

#### Copulas

Parameterization of copulas

Generally this is done by using estimates of the rank correlation of the data

* Set the true, underlying correlation of the copula to = these estimated correlations
* Specific circumstances will influene the choice of whether to use Kendall's $\tau$ or Spearman's $\rho$

***For Archimedean copulas***

* Gumbel, Clayton, and Frank are all characterized by $\alpha$ via their generators $\therefore$ estiamte the value of $\alpha$ based on the observed data
* See mod 18 for relationships between $\alpha$ and $\tau$
* So estimate the value of $\tau$ with the data and use the formulas to set it equal to the expression of $\alpha$ and then solve
* e.g. Gumbel: $\tau = 1 - \dfrac{1}{\alpha} \Rightarrow \alpha = \dfrac{1}{1 - \tau}$

#### Features of the method of moments

***Advantages***

* Generally more straightforward to use than other alternatives

***Disadvantages***

* Parameters not necessarily the most likely ones
* Parameter values may be outside their acceptable ranges

### Maximum Likelihood

#### Features of MLE

**Advantages**

* Only generates parameter values that are within the acceptable ranges
* Any bias in the parameter estimates reduces as the number of observations increases
* Distribution of each parameter estimate tends toward the normal distribution

#### Univariate Distribution

Parameterization of Univariate Distribution

**likelihood function**:  
Expresses the joint probability of the actual observations ($x_1,...,x_T$) occurring, given the choice of candidate distribution

**Maximize** (w.r.t. each parameter) the **log likelihood function**  
$\ln L = \sum \limits_{t=1}^T \ln f(x_t)$

* $f(x)$ is the marginal PDF of $X$
* Effectively maximizing the joint porbability $L=\prod_{t=1}^T f(x_t)$
* Involve solving several simultaneous equations of the form $\partial (\ln (L)) / \partial p_i = 0$ where $p_i (i=1,...,N)$ is one of the $N$ parameters of the candidate distribution

#### N-dimensional copulas

Parameterization of N-dimensional copulas

For MLE we require the density function of the copula $c(u_1,...,u_N) = \dfrac{\partial^N C(u_1,...,u_n)}{\partial u_1 ... \partial u_N}$

* $N$ is the number of variables (= dimensions of the copula)
* $u_n = F(x_n)$ for $n= 1,...,N$

Evaluate the log-likelihood function using the $T$ observations

$\begin{align}
  \ln\left(L(\boldsymbol{\theta})\right) =& \ln \left(\prod_{t=1}^T c_{\theta}(u_{1,t},  u_{2,t},...,u_{N,t})\right) \\
  =& \sum \limits_{t=1}^T \ln \left(c_{\theta}(u_{1,t},  u_{2,t},...,u_{N,t})\right) \\
\end{align}$

Maximization gets more complex as the number of variables increase

* In practice this is done using a suitable computer package and the application of numerical methods

***Obtaining the copula density fucntion***

Recall: If all distribution functions are continuous then:

$c(u_1,...u_N) = \dfrac{f(x_1,...,x_N)}{f(x_1)f(x_2)...f(x_N)}$

And if these marginal density function are available in closed form then the probabilities can be expressed in terms of the unknown parameters ($\boldsymbol{\theta}$) and the log likelihood function maximized

Alternatively the values of $u_{n,t} = F(X_{n,t})$ can be derived empirically from the observations and used to calculate the log likelihood function for the cnadidate copula, maximizing to determine the optimum paramter values

***Gaussian copula***

MLE of the sample covariance matrix:

$\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}} = \dfrac{1}{T} \sum \limits_{t=1}^T \boldsymbol{\Phi}_t^{-1} \left(\boldsymbol{\Phi}_t^{-1}\right)'$

* $\boldsymbol{\Phi}_t^{-1} = \left[ \Phi^{-1}\left( F \left( x_{1,t} \right) \right), \Phi^{-1}\left( F \left( x_{2,t} \right) \right),..., \Phi^{-1}\left( F \left( x_{N,t} \right) \right) \right]'$

E.g. Derivation of the sample covariance matrix when $t=1$ and $N=2$ if the marginal distributions are $N(0,1)$

$\begin{align}
  \hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}} &= \boldsymbol{\Phi}_t^{-1} \left(\boldsymbol{\Phi}_t^{-1}\right)' \\
  &= \begin{bmatrix}
      \Phi^{-1}_{X_1} \left( F_{X_1} \left( x_{1} \right) \right) \\
      \Phi^{-1}_{X_2} \left( F_{X_2} \left( x_{2} \right) \right) \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \Phi^{-1}_{X_1} \left( F_{X_1} \left( x_{1} \right) \right) &
      \Phi^{-1}_{X_2} \left( F_{X_2} \left( x_{2} \right) \right) \\
    \end{bmatrix} \\
  &= \begin{bmatrix}
      \left(\Phi^{-1}_{X_1} \left( F_{X_1} \left( x_{1} \right) \right)\right)^2 &
      \Phi^{-1}_{X_1} \left( F_{X_1} \left( x_{1} \right) \right)
      \Phi^{-1}_{X_2} \left( F_{X_2} \left( x_{2} \right) \right) \\
      \Phi^{-1}_{X_2} \left( F_{X_2} \left( x_{2} \right) \right)
      \Phi^{-1}_{X_1} \left( F_{X_1} \left( x_{1} \right) \right) &
      \left(\Phi^{-1}_{X_2} \left( F_{X_2} \left( x_{2} \right) \right)\right)^2 \\
    \end{bmatrix} \\
  & =\begin{bmatrix}
      x^2_1 & x_1x_2 \\
      x_2x_1 & x^2_2 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}$

#### Choosing between candidate copulas

1. Determined optimum parameter values for each candidate copula
2. Compare the values of the ML functions (evaluting using the observations and the relevant optium parameters) to select the optimal overall model

## Fitting a Model to Data

### Least Squares Regression

Model the r.v. $Y_t$ (for $t=1,2,...,T$) with $N$ independent explanatory variables $X_{t,n}$ ($n=1,2,...,N$)

$Y_t = \beta_1 X_{t,1} + \beta_2 X_{t,2} + \dots + \beta_N X_{t,N} + \epsilon_t

* $\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$
* $\epsilon_t$ quantifies the degree to which the variables $X_{t,n}$ fail to fully explain the dependent variable $Y_t$
* $\beta_1$ can be a constant if we set $X_{t,1}$ to be a fixed amount for all $t$

#### Ordinary Least Squares

For OLS the $\beta_n$s are selected to minimize the SSE:  
$\boldsymbol{\epsilon}'\boldsymbol{\epsilon} = \epsilon^2_1 + \epsilon^2_2 + \dots + \epsilon^2_T$

Closed form solution for the minimization problem:  
$\mathbf{b} = \left(\hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2, ... ,\hat{\beta}_N \right)' = (\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{Y}$

***Assumptions***

* Linear relationship between variables (variables with non-linear relationships need to be first transform before fitting)
* Inverse of the data exists  
(i.e. has full column rank, no colunn is a linear transformation or combination of any others)
* Error terms are not corrleated with each other  
(i.e. no serial correlation exists that has not been modeled by the explanatory variables)
* Error terms have a constand and finite variance $\sigma^2$
* Error terms are normally distributed (needed for the significance tests)

#### Generalized Least Squares

For GLS, the variance of the error terms is not necessarily assumed to be constand and they don't have to be uncorrelated with each other

Let varianes and covariances of the error terms = $\sigma^2 \boldsymbol{\Omega}$

* $\sigma^2$: constant
* $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$: Matrix of weightings

Then:

* **Uncorrelated error** terms with non-constand variance can be modeled by setting: $\boldsymbol{\Omega} = diag(\Omega_{1,1}, \Omega_{2,2},...,\Omega_{T,T})$
    * A diagonal matrix with entries that adjust(scale) $\sigma^2$ appropriately over time
* Error terms with **serial correlation** but constand variance can be modeled by including correlations between observations in the off-diagonal entries of $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ and setting the diagonal entries all to 1
* Both **heteroskedastic** and **serial correlation**  
$\sigma^2 \Omega = \sigma^2
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \Omega_{1,1} & \rho_{1,2} & \dots & \rho_{1,T} \\
    \rho_{2,1} & \Omega_{2,2} & \dots & \rho_{2,T} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    \rho_{T,1} & \rho_{T,2} & \dots & \Omega_{T,T} \\
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma^2_1 & \sigma_{1,2} & \dots & \sigma_{1,T} \\
    \sigma_{2,1} & \sigma^2_2 & \dots & \sigma_{2,T} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    \sigma_{T,1} & \sigma_{T,2} & \dots & \sigma^2_T \\
  \end{bmatrix}$
  
Closed form solution of minimizing the SSE:  
$\mathbf{b} = (b_1,b_2,...,b_N)' = (\mathbf{X}'\boldsymbol{\Omega}^{-1}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\boldsymbol{\Omega}^{-1}\mathbf{Y}$

***Test of the overall fit***

Coefficients of determination[^Cod] ($R^2$) can be used to determine the overall fit

* Higher values = better fit
* Use adjusted coefficient of determination[^AdjCod] ($R_{\alpha}^2$), which does not automatically increase just by adding extra parameters

Can use F-test[^Ftest] to test the overall regression results (if the error terms are normally distributed)

* $H_0$ is that all regression coefficiens are zero

[^Cod]: $R^2 = \dfrac{SSR}{SST} = 1 - \dfrac{SSE}{SST} \in [0,1]$
    
    Where:

    $\begin{array}{c,c,c,c,c,c}
      &SST &= &SSR &+ &SSE \\
      & \sum \limits_{t=1}^T(Y_t - \bar{Y})^2 &= &\sum \limits_{t=1}^T(\hat{Y}_t - \bar{Y})^2 &+ &\sum \limits_{t=1}^T(\underbrace{Y_t - \hat{Y}_t}_{\epsilon_t^2})^2 \\
    \end{array}$
    
    * $SST$: = total sum of squares
    * $SSR$ = sum of squares explained by regression
    * $SSE$ = sum of squares error (unexplained deviations)
    * Average of the observation: $\bar{Y} = \dfrac{1}{T}\sum \limits_{t=1}^T Y_t$
    * Predicted value: $\hat{Y}_t = \sum \limits_{n=1}^N b_n x_{t,n}$
    
[^AdjCod]: $R_{\alpha}^2 = 1 - \dfrac{SSE/(T-N)}{SST/(T-1)} = 1 - \dfrac{T-1}{T-N}(1-R^2)$

[^Ftest]: $\dfrac{SSR/(N-1)}{SSE/(T-N)} = dfrac{R^2/(N-1)}{(1-R^2)/(T-N)} \sim F^{N-1}_{T-N}$

***Test of the individual regression coefficients***

Test whether each variable is significant by estimating the variance of the error terms [^SSquare]

If we assume normally distributed errors, we can use the t-test

* $H_0$ is the $\beta_n$ is 0
* test is for the level of significant by which the coefficient ($b_n$) differs from zero

[^SSquare]: $s^2 = \dfrac{SSE}{T-N}$
    
    Where:
    
    * Deduction of the number of explanatory variables ($N$) in the denominator ensures that the estimate is unbiased
    * $s$ is called the standard error of the regression
    
    Sample covariance matrix for the vector of estimates $\mathbf{b}$ is $\mathbf{S_b}= s^2(\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X})^{-1}$
    
    Sqaure root of the $n$th element of the diagonal in $\mathbf{S}_b is $s_{b_n}$, the standard error of the estimate $b_n$
    
    Assuming normally distributed error term, we can use the t-test with the following statistics:  
    $\dfrac{b_n - \beta_n}{s_{b_n}} \sim t_{T-N}$\
    
    Typical confidence leve is 90%

### Methods based on Likelihood Functions

#### Likelihood ratio test

Similar when fitting distributions but iterative techniques maybe required

**Nested models**:  
If the second model contains all the independent variables of the first plus some additional variables

**Likelihood ratio test**:  
Used to test whether the addition of these variables results in significantly improved explanatory power

* $H_0$ is that it is not the case
* Test statistics: $LR = -2 \ln(L_1/L_2) \sim \chi^2_{N_2 - N_1}$
    * $L_1$ and $L_2$ are the values of the likelihood functions for the 2 models
    * $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the \# of independent variables in each model incl. the constants
    
#### Information Criteria (IC)

Use to compare alternative models

IC are not restricted to the comparison of nested models as is the case with likelihood ratio tests

IC only enable the ranking of alternative models

* Does not quantify the statistical significant of any differences between the alternatives

**Akaike Information Criterion** (AIC)

$AIC = 2N - 2 \ln(L)$

**Bayesian Information Critersion** (BIC)

$BIC = N \ln(T) - 2 \ln(L)$

$N$: \# of independent variables in the model

$T$: \# of observations

Lower the value of AIC the better the fit of the model to the data

BIC penalizes the introduction of another independent variable more severely and so its used tends to result in less complex models being selected compared to when using AIC

### Principal Component Analysis

Fit data to independent parameters weighting their relative importance by the size of their eigenvalues (Mod 16)

### Singular Value Decomposition

**Advantage** of PCA

* Readily faciliates stochastic projections

**Disadvantage** of PCA

* Model parameters do not necessarily have any intuitive interpretation (limited explanatory power)
* Requires identification of the covariance matrix for the chosen $N$ independent explanatory variables

**Advantage** of SVD over PCA

* Based on a least squares optimzation but does not require identification of the covariance matrix
* Operates on the original data with no requirement to identify independent variables upon which to base a regression


**Assumptions** for using SVD

* SVD determine the best linear relationship between the values of a set of $N$ variables $X_{1,t},X_{2,t},...,X_{N,t}$ at each time $t$
* If we assume the relationship continues i.e. if we have a new row of data for time $N+1$, we can use this relationship to predict the value of one or more "missing" future data values for these variables

***Process of applying SVD*** to a set of $M$ observations of $N$ variables

Let $\mathbf{X}$ ($M \times N$ matrix) be a set of $M$ observations of $N$ variables

If $\mathbf{X}$ has column rank $R$ then it can be expressed as the linear combination of $R$ orthogonal matrices

* Where each matrices cannot be expressed as a linear combination of each others

And in turn, each orthogonal matrices an be brokend down as produce of 2 vectors:

$\begin{bmatrix}
  X_{1,1} & X_{1,2} & \dots & X_{1,N} \\
  X_{2,1} & X_{2,2} & \dots & X_{2,N} \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  X_{M,1} & X_{M,2} & \dots & X_{M,N} \\
\end{bmatrix} =
\sum \limits_{i=1}^R L_i
\begin{bmatrix}
  U_{1,i} \\
  U_{2,i} \\
  \vdots \\
  U_{M,i} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  V_{1,i} & V_{2,i} \dots V_{N,i} \\
\end{bmatrix}$

**Singular values** $L_i$:

* Square roots of the eigenvectors of $\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}'$
* $L_1$ is the largest with ever decreasing subsequent value down to $L_R$

**Left singular vectors**: $\mathbf{U}_i$

**Right singular vectors**: $\mathbf{V}_i$

The 3 components above are found from the original dataset using an iterative method (rather than covariance matrix as in PCA)

Similar to PCA, a large proportion of the variation in a series of data might be explained by a small number of factors so the iterative process might be terminated before all the singular vectors have been determined e.g. when $L_r$ is sufficiently small $\Rightarrow$ We can make good predictions of future data values based on a small subset of the other variables

(See more details in appendix)
