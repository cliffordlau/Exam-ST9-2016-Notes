## Module Objective

Demostrate the application of ERM to real and hypothetical contexts

* Discuss important past examples of both good risk management practices and risk failure, and discuss how better risk management might have prevented these failures
* Analyse hypothetical examples ex ante and discuss how the situations described benefti from risk management

***

Need to be able to apply the principle described in earlier modules, in the context of both `real` and `imaginary` situations and for both `financial` and `non-financial` organizations

Purpose of the module is to demonstrate the application of ERM to real-life situations

* Most important module for ST9
* **Expectation from ST9**:
    * Discuss past examples of good risk management practices
    * Discuss past examples of risk failures
    * Discuss how better risk management might have prevented these failures
    
**Important** to read the case studied in the Core Reading and are prepared to discuss the key learning points and outcomes of these real-life examples

* Need to be able to apply these lessons and the broader knowledge gained throughout the course to hypothetical situations ex ante
* Discribe how risk management may be applied in any given situation
* This include the analysis of financial statements

### Reading the Case Studies

Tips:

* Read the case study in full
* Read again more critically

Questions to consider on 2^nd^ pass:

* Why is this case study interesting from ST9's perspective?
* How would you describe the companies' risk management practices?
* What types of risks is this case study concentrating on?
* What were the key risk management failure and/or successes in this case?
* Could any failures have been foreseen or mitigated by better risk management practices?
* What are the key lessons to be learnt from this case study?
* Did the company learn from its failures, or benefit from its good practices?
* Can you relate any of these lessons to your own business or other businesses you work with?

## Case Study Summaries

Should consider the relative important of all categories of risk

Should identify the **root causes** of a major loss or failure

* e.g. root cause of the failure of Barings Bank was an op-risk, inadequate internal management controls; while the collapse of the bank was ultimately caused by a different op-risk (Kobe EQ) and market risk but the collapse would not have happened if proper internal controls had been in place

Sweeting cases are largy self-explanatory

Useful to be familiar with the details on the case, the key is to **understand the lessons** from each case study and **to be able to relate** those to other institutions

Notes below provide more detail on some of the case studies and provide references for you to do further research
