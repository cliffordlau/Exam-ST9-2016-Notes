**RM can benefit society**

* Modern Society relies on the banking and financial systems to operate smoothly

Risk appetite and risk profile

* Need a clear statement of risk appetite and profile to make decisions on which risk to accept or avoid
* Risk appetite = risk a company is willing to accept on an ongoing basis
* Risk profile = types of risks that a company faces and its current exposure to those risks

## Benefits of ERM

**1. $\uparrow$ risk transparency $\Rightarrow$ management more informed $\Rightarrow$ improve business performance**

ERM takes responsibility for risk reporting across the whole organization to ensure that *all risks* are reported in a *consistent* and appropriate format to stakeholders thereby $\uparrow$ *risk transparency*

$\Downarrow$

ERM allows senior management to be more informed when making decisions due to:

* Better understanding of risk exposure
* Better comprehension of the links between growth, corporate risk and return
* Better understanding of the impact of $\Delta$-ing external factors (e.g. interest rate)
* More accureate accessment of a decisions's risk/return trade-offs
* Align strategy more closely with risk appetite

$\Downarrow$

## Reasons to Initiate ERM

Stakeholder's expectation of effective risk management practice due to increased in available tools to assess and manage risk

Company usually pressured to implement ERM due to:

* Previous management failures
* Near miss
* High profile disaster in another organization
* Regulator/auditor criticism or demands
* Other stakeholders concerns

## How ERM Addes Value

Based on Lam Ch.21 case study

* Investors will pay a premium for well governed companies
    * On the flip side, they would avoid companies with poor governance standards

Companies with strong governance structures:

* Sought after by investors
* Purchased at a premium (12-30%)
* Tend to outperform companies with weaker governance
* Lower volatility of returns, improved s/h value, financial stability, 16% equity premium (For insurance companies)
* Perform better during stock market crashes (e.g. 2008, companies with excellent S&P EMR rating did better)

Effect is amplified for larger companies
