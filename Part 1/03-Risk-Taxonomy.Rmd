## Module Objective

Definitions and concepts of risks

Meaning of risk and uncertainty

Understanding of risk categories

* Market, economic, interest rate, FX, basis, counterparty, liquidity, insurance, operational, legal, regulatory, political, agency, reputational, project, strategic, demographic, moral hazard

Relationship between:

* systematic risk and non-systematic risk
* Specific risk and concentration risk

How contagion affects different stakeholders

## Intro to Risk Taxonomy

Risk taxonomy = definitions and categoriztions of risks

Risk = 

* Uncertainty of possible future random events
* Nature and degree of harm associated with each such event

Risk hierarchy based on Basel or SII

* Market risk: risks arising from changes in market values
* Credit risk: risk of failure oif a 3rd party to make promised payments
* Op risk: risk of loss resulting from deficient internal processes, people, or systems, or external events
* Insurance risk: risk of accepting risks which turn out to be inappropriate or pricing accepted risks inappropriately
* Strategic risk (from Lam)  
* Regulatory risk (from Lam)

Market + credit = financial risks

## Categorization of risk {.tabset}

List not necessarily complete

Definitions are not necessarily set in stone and can be inconsistent depending on the context (e.g. market risk)

### Market risk

<a name="mkt-risk"></a>

* Risks from $\Delta$ investment market value
* Correlation with investment markets (e.g. interest and inflation)
* Investment market value $\Delta$ on liabilities
* Consequence of AL mismatch
* e.g. equity, commodity, FX, interest rate, basis

Sometimes can be confused with risk of lower sales or profit margins from changes in market conditions

* Here market = market where the products or services are sold

Market conditions are a fucntion of:

* Market construction:  
Size, barriers to entry
* Market participant action:  
Strategic choise (growth vs specialist penetration or diversification), method of implementation (expansion or acquisition)
* Market participant interaction:  
Price elasticity

Distinct elements of market risks:

* Risk arising from movements in own stock price related to:
    * acquisition strength and takeover risk
    * efficiency in raising capital
* Investment risks related to:
    * Interest rate risk associated with holding liquid funds in fixed income
    * ALM risk
    * Effect on pension scheme liabilities
* Uncertainty of input and output prices

Types of market risks

| Type | Cause | Characteristics | Exposed |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| Trading Risk | $\Delta$ prices or rates; Other market driven risks; Basis risks | Short term; Able to close-out or hedge in a few days | Investment bank; Dealers; Market-making energy fimrs; non-financials w/ trading book |
| ALM | Unmatched interest rate sensitivity; FX; basis | Takes longer to close out; Can be hedged more frequently | Banks; Investment banks; Insurance co.; Energy firms |
| Liquidity Risk | Inability to fund financial obligations without sizeable losses; Insufficient market capacity leading to adverse impact on market price when deal required | Short term | All companies and investors |

### Economic Risk

<a name="econ-risk"></a>

Risks arising from the impact of macro factors

* Aggregate supply and demand
* Government policies (own and foreign e.g. trade barriers)
* Unemployment levels
* Inflation, interest and FX
* Accomodation costs

***

### Interest Rate Risk

Risk from $\Delta$ interest rates

* Impact on customer behavior or financial impact

Subset of [market risk](#mkt-risk) or [economic risk](#econ-risk)

***

### FX Risk

Risk from exposure to movement in FX rates

Subset of [market risk](#mkt-risk) or [economic risk](#econ-risk)

Effect of FX rate movements:

* Transaction exposure: foreign revenues expressed in the home currency
* Economic exposure: prices of exported good affecting foreign sales
* Tranlsation exposure: consolidated accounts

***

### Basis Risk

Risk from differences in the movements of two comparable indices

* E.g. Different stock indices so that offsetting investments in a hedging strategy doesn't experience exactly offsetting movements

***

### Credit & Counterparty Risk

Credit Risk:

* Risk that a counterparty to an agreement will be unable or unwilling to make the payments required
* A more narrow definition:  
Risk that a borrower will partially or wholly default on repayment of debt

Counterparty risk:

* Risk that another party to an agreement fails to perform its contractual obligations (or perform in a timely manner)
* e.g. default on derivatives transaction or failure of an outsourcing company


Typically considered under the wider credit risk category or use interchangably

* Risk of loss due to contractual obligations not being met (quantity, quality, or timing) either in part or in full, whether due to inability of, or decision by, the counterparty

Components of credit risk:

1. Probability of default (PD)
2. Loss given default (LGD)

Credit risk can sometimes include risks relating to variations in credit spreads in the market

* In Sweeting, $\Delta$ in asset value due to $\Delta$ credit spread is a market risk

Example of credit risk (Lam):

* Late payment by creditors
* Financial loss due to counterparty failure to uphold agreement
* Loss of provision or receipt of services by a 3^rd^ party (due to credit problems or bankruptcy)

***

### Liquidity Risk

Risk of not being able to meet short-term cashflow requirements

Funding liqudity risk:  
Risk of money markets not being able to supply funding to businesses when required

Market liquidity risk:  
Insufficient capacity in the market to handle asset transactions at the time when the deal is required (w/o material impact on price)

***

### Insurance Risk

Risk arises from fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of insured events, relative to the expectations of the firm at the time of underwriting or pricing (Mortality, morbidity, P&C risks)

* Can include persistency and expense risks for insurance companies
* Typically same as underwriting risk
    * Alternatively, u/w risk can mean risk of inappropriate selection and approval of insurance risks (for P&C company this is typically bucketed under Op-Risk)
* Lam calls this actuarial risk
    
Components of insurance risk

* Demographic risk
    * Mortality and longevity risks
    * Morbidity risks (diagnosis of critical illness)
    * Proportions married and age differences of partners
* Non-life insurance risk
    * Property or casualty risk
* Other insurance risk
    * Persistency risk (uncertainty in # of policies renewing)
    * Expense risk (expense not being as expected)
    
Further subcategory of non-life or demographic risk

* Underwriting risk (level risk):  
Risk that underlying claims incidence (and severity) is not as expected
* Reserving risk
    * Volatility risk: uncertainty due to only having a finite pool of policies
    * CAT risk
    * Trend or cycle risk: risk of future changes in claims frequency and severity

***
    
### Operational Risk

Risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events

* Basel definition includes legal risk but exclude strategic and reputational risk

Components of Op-Risk:

* Process risk
    * e.g. efficieny vs effectiveness;
    * Processing errors result in costs (customer turnover, loss of reputation, etc)
    * Inadequate documentations lead to costs (miscommunications)
    * Model and data risk
* People risk
    * e.g. Key positions remaining unfilled
    * Wrong people are hired/retained
    * Absenteeism
    * Lack of risk awareness
    * Incompetence
    * Dishonesty
    * Agency risk
    * Moral hazard
    * Adverse selection
* System/technology risk
    * Since it requires significant investment, compolex project management to introduce or change and effective oversight/governance
    * Out dated funtionality
    * Lack of sufficient access or capacity
    * Unauthorized use or access to data
    * Failure of technology
    * Inadequate backup or disaster plan
    * Software errors
* Event risk
    * Business continuity risk (inadequate contingency plans)
    * Ineffective internal change management (effecting a merger)
    * Ineffective external change management (adapting to regulations change)
* Business risk (including reputational risk)
    * Inappropriate business strategy
    * Inadequate business plans
    * Change in business environment
    * Results not meeting stakeholder expectations
    * Damage to reputation or brand value
* Crime risk (categoried under its origin)
    * People risk (dishonest staff); technology risk (hacking); legal risk
* Other examples
    * Deficient product $\Rightarrow$ liability claim
    * Sub-optimal product development
    * Human error $\Rightarrow$ CAT event
    * Inappropriate corporate strategy
    * Ineffective internal feedback mechanism
    * Corporate culture that limits innovation and resists change

Maybe move to Mod 29

Pros and cons of outsourcing

* Pros:
    * Specialist organization can increase capacity, reduce costs, time, better quality etc.
    * Transfer operational and other risks to the 3^rd^ party
* Cons:
    * Introduce new risks e.g. legal
    * Lose direct control over the risks now being experienced and managed in the outsourcer (product quality)
    
***

### Legal Risk

Risk from the understanding of and adherence to legislation, including changes in accepted interpretation

* Breaching the law (lack of aweareness, understanding, changes in interpretation by courts, deliberate intent)
* Inability to demonstrate compliance

Consequences: fines, change in credit rating, loss of resources, reputational damage

Legal risks are threefold:

1. New legislation due to political or social pressures (can be +/-)
    * (+) Open up new business opportunities given that they responds to the new legislation before competitors
    * (-) Additional compliance costs or prohibit some of an organization's activities
        * Company should be aware at the earliest stage of the possibility of new legislation
        
2. Provisions in important contracts could give risk to significant problems if certain circumstances where to occur

3. Court judgements against an organization
    * e.g. Collapse of Equitable Life in UK
    * Need to consider whether the risk of an adverse legal judgement is worthwhile or not
    
Legal is typically under Op-Risk
