## Intro to Risk Taxonomy

Risk taxonomy = definitions and categoriztions of risks

Risk = 

* Uncertainty of possible future random events
* Nature and degree of harm associated with each such event

Risk hierarchy based on Basel or SII

* Market risk: risks arising from changes in market values
* Credit risk: risk of failure oif a 3rd party to make promised payments
* Op risk: risk of loss resulting from deficient internal processes, people, or systems, or external events
* Insurance risk: risk of accepting risks which turn out to be inappropriate or pricing accepted risks inappropriately
* Strategic risk (from Lam)  
* Regulatory risk (from Lam)

Market + credit = financial risks

Definitions can be inconsistent

## Categorization of risk

List not necessarily complete

**Market risk**

* Risks from $\Delta$ investment market value
* Correlation with investment markets (e.g. interest and inflation)
* Investment market value $\Delta$ on liabilities
* Consequence of AL mismatch
* e.g. equity, commodity, FX, interest rate, basis

Sometimes can be confused with risk of lower sales or profit margins from changes in market conditions

* Here market = market where the products or services are sold

Market conditions are a fucntion of:

* Market construction:  
Size, barriers to entry
* Market participant action:  
Strategic choise (growth vs specialist penetration or diversification), method of implementation (expansion or acquisition)
* Market participant interaction:  
Price elasticity

Distinct elements of market risks:

* Risk arising from movements in own stock price related to:
    * acquisition strength and takeover risk
    * efficiency in raising capital
* Investment risks related to:
    * Interest rate risk associated with holding liquid funds in fixed income
    * ALM risk
    * Effect on pension scheme liabilities
* Uncertainty of input and output prices
